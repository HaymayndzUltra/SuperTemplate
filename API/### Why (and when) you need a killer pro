### Why (and when) you need a killer proposal

Bottom line up front: Great proposals win great clients.
But the reality is a bit more complicated than that.
The freelance industry is growing rapidly — almost [one-third of the American workforce is considered freelance](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/15/a-snapshot-of-the-1point2-trillion-freelance-economy-in-the-us-in-2020.html), contributing $1.2 trillion to the economy.
Keep in mind that this number is somewhat inflated since Uber / Lyft drivers and similar gig work is also counted as freelance.
However, even discounting those numbers, more and more potential freelancers join the workforce each and every year.
On top of that, freelancing (like any industry) can be somewhat “top-heavy.”
A glut of talent can lead to race-to-the-bottom pricing and make it difficult for new talent to break into a competitive market.
People that are just starting up can find it hard to land new jobs so they’re often forced to start with low hourly rates until they make a name for themselves.
That’s especially the case for people working on freelancing platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer.com, where prospective clients often look at previous freelance projects and portfolios as key hiring factors.
On the other hand, experts with years of professional experience are highly sought-after and they easily book more jobs than they can handle.
IT, admin, accounting and data entry are all very [particularly popular](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/top-freelance-career-fields/).
Most freelancing fields are highly competitive and, in situations where you’re up against more experienced freelancers or highly talented individuals a strong proposal can be the difference between closing the deal and pounding the digital pavement.
Here’s how to write that winning proposal.
