# REPORT MUST ANALYZE

Summary
The workflow is well-structured with rigorous gates, approvals, and handoffs. Review protocols and CI workflows exist and are detailed. However, many protocol-referenced gate scripts (CR/SR/AR and numbered gates) are missing in the repository, and several CI snippets show mismatched script names. Protocols lack explicit guidance for template-pack selection despite a strong generator system. Validators exist but are not directly integrated by protocols. Prioritized fixes: reconcile script references (or provide fallbacks), correct CI gate invocations, and add a protocol-level template selection step.

Findings
Missing gate scripts referenced by protocols (CR/SR/AR and numbered gates)
Evidence:
python scripts/validate_prerequisites_CR.py python scripts/validate_gate_CR_standards.py --issues .artifacts/review-code/design-issues.json python scripts/validate_gate_CR_tests.py --report .artifacts/review-code/test-validation-report.json python scripts/validate_gate_CR_feedback.py --log .artifacts/review-code/feedback-log.csv python scripts/aggregate_evidence_CR.py --output .artifacts/review-code/

    ```353:360:/workspace/.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/12-quality-audit.md
python scripts/validate_prerequisites_4.py
python scripts/validate_gate_4_pre_audit.py --threshold 0.80
python scripts/validate_gate_4_reporting.py --threshold 0.95
python scripts/aggregate_evidence_4.py --output .artifacts/quality-audit/
Insufficient evidence to conclude presence for these scripts under scripts/ (no matching files found in repository search).

Impact: Protocol automation is not runnable as-specified; gates can’t be executed automatically.

Confidence: High.

CI/automation snippet mismatches

Evidence (Protocol 11 file shows a job named “Protocol 15 Validation” and runs run_protocol_9_gates.py):
name: Protocol 15 Validation on: [push, pull_request] jobs: validate: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Run Protocol 15 Gates run: python scripts/run_protocol_9_gates.py

  - Evidence (Protocol 15 runs `run_protocol_11_gates.py`):
    ```367:383:/workspace/.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/15-production-deployment.md
# GitHub Actions workflow integration
name: Protocol 15 Validation
...
      - name: Run Protocol 15 Gates
        run: python scripts/run_protocol_11_gates.py
Impact: Confusing/incorrect CI wiring; increases risk of running wrong gate set or failing builds.

Confidence: High.

Human approval gates are present and explicit

Evidence:
Required Approvals
[ ] Quality orchestrator authorization to commence integration testing
[ ] Environment owner confirmation that integration environment matches baseline
System State Requirements
[ ] ... Automation scripts ...
    ```20:24:/workspace/.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/15-production-deployment.md
### Required Approvals
- [ ] Executive sponsor or Product Owner authorization to deploy to production
- [ ] SRE/Operations lead approval confirming monitoring coverage
- [ ] Security lead sign-off if release includes security-impacting changes
Impact: Clear decision points align with solo developer operations and risk containment.

Confidence: High.

Protocol handoffs are coherent and forward-only

Evidence:
Handoff to Protocol 12:
[MASTER RAY™ | PROTOCOL COMPLETE] Ready for Protocol 12: Quality Audit ...

Trigger next protocol
@apply .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/12-quality-audit.md

    ```417:427:/workspace/.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/15-production-deployment.md
### Handoff to Protocol 16:
**[MASTER RAY™ | PROTOCOL COMPLETE]** Ready for Protocol 16: Monitoring & Observability
...
@apply .cursor/ai-driven-workflow/16-monitoring-observability.md
Impact: Reduces risk of cycles; supports auditable progression.

Confidence: High.

Rules ↔ Protocol alignment (self-identification, modification safety, comprehension)

Evidence (self-identification rule):
AI Model Self-Identification Protocol
... At the beginning of every interaction, you MUST identify yourself by stating your actual AI model name and version...

  - Evidence (code modification safety expectations):
    ```5:20:/workspace/.cursor/rules/master-rules/4-master-rule-code-modification-safety-protocol.mdc
# Master Rule: Code Modification Safety Protocol
...
**[STRICT]** Before any modification, you MUST:
- Confirm the Target
- Validate File Location
- Read the Latest Version
...
Evidence (protocols contain required sections enforced by validators):
REQUIRED_SECTIONS = [ ("PREREQUISITES", r"PREREQUISITES"), ("AI ROLE AND MISSION", r"AI ROLE AND MISSION"), ("WORKFLOW", r"WORKFLOW"), ("INTEGRATION POINTS", r"INTEGRATION POINTS"), ("QUALITY GATES", r"QUALITY GATES"), ("COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS", r"COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS"), ("AUTOMATION HOOKS", r"AUTOMATION HOOKS"), ("HANDOFF CHECKLIST", r"HANDOFF CHECKLIST"), ("EVIDENCE SUMMARY", r"EVIDENCE SUMMARY") ]

  - Impact: Protocols adhere to global constraints; validator enforces structure.
  - Confidence: High.

- Template-pack integration exists via generator, but protocols lack explicit selection/usage steps
  - Evidence (generator uses template-packs):
    ```386:399:/workspace/project_generator/core/generator.py
template_root = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent / 'template-packs' / 'frontend' / self.args.frontend
variant_path = template_root / variant
...
self._process_templates(frontend_dir)
```408:434:/workspace/project_generator/core/generator.py
template_path = Path(file).parent.parent.parent / 'template-packs' / 'backend' / self.args.backend ... shutil.copytree(variant_path, backend_dir, dirs_exist_ok=True)

  - Insufficient evidence to conclude protocols instruct explicit template selection or generator usage.
  - Impact: Missed opportunity to guide consistent scaffolding at Protocol 05–07.
  - Confidence: High.

- Validators-system provides robust checks, but protocols do not call it directly
  - Evidence (validators capability):
    ```1:16:/workspace/validators-system/scripts/validate_protocol_identity.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"Protocol Identity Validator"
...
Insufficient evidence to conclude direct invocation from protocols (no references found).

Impact: Validation may rely on CI workflows rather than protocol automation hooks.

Confidence: Medium-High.

CI integration to validate workflow connectivity exists

Evidence:
name: Validate Dev-Workflow Integration on: push: branches: [ main, develop ] ...

    ```41:49:/workspace/.github/workflows/validate-integration.yml
python scripts/validate_workflow_integration.py --verbose --output .artifacts/validation-results.json
bash scripts/test_workflow_integration.sh --keep
Impact: Automated detection of misalignments; current findings imply it should be flagging missing scripts.
Confidence: High.
Gaps and Risks
Missing gate scripts referenced by protocols

Severity: High
Confidence: High
Affected: Multiple protocols (CR/SR/AR, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23)
Evidence: See code references above; Insufficient evidence to conclude presence of scripts/validate_gate_* and run_protocol_*_gates.py.
CI snippet/script mismatches (wrong protocol numbers in filenames)

Severity: Medium
Confidence: High
Affected: Protocol 11 and 15 CI examples
Evidence: Protocol 11 uses run_protocol_9_gates.py; Protocol 15 uses run_protocol_11_gates.py.
Protocols lack explicit template-pack selection/usage guidance

Severity: Medium
Confidence: High
Affected: Early protocols (05–07)
Evidence: Template usage exists in generator; no protocol references found.
Validators not directly referenced in protocol automation hooks

Severity: Low-Medium
Confidence: Medium-High
Affected: Protocol automation sections
Evidence: Validators exist; no direct protocol references.
Recommendations
Title: Reconcile protocol-referenced gate scripts or provide fallbacks

Action Steps:
Implement minimal gate scripts for each referenced validate_gate_* and run_protocol_*_gates.py, or update protocols to reference existing, real scripts (e.g., consolidate gate checks into scripts/validate_workflow_integration.py).
Add a central scripts/script-registry.json entry per new script and enforce with Protocol 23.
Expected Outcome: Protocol automation becomes runnable; CI failures reduced.
Effort: M
Risk: Low-Medium.
Title: Correct CI snippets and align gate runner names

Action Steps:
Update Protocol 11 and 15 CI examples to reference the correct runner names and protocol numbers.
Add a test in scripts/validate_workflow_integration.py to detect protocol-number mismatches in example YAML.
Expected Outcome: Clear, accurate CI wiring; fewer operator errors.
Effort: S
Risk: Low.
Title: Add protocol-level template-pack selection and generator step

Action Steps:
In Protocol 05–07, add a “Template Selection & Generator” step referencing scripts/generate_client_project.py with required inputs and evidence outputs (e.g., generator-config.json, scaffold manifests).
Include decision criteria for stacks and compliance.
Expected Outcome: Standardized scaffolding across projects; better integration of template-packs.
Effort: M
Risk: Low.
Confidence and Limitations
Confidence: High for identified gaps (missing scripts, CI mismatches, approvals/gates presence, generator/template integration). Medium-High for validators-system integration assertions.
Limitations: Some findings note “Insufficient evidence to conclude presence” where files were not found; if stored outside scripts/, provide locations to re-check.
Next Steps
Approve recommendations.

Implement missing or corrected scripts and CI snippet updates.

Add template-pack steps to Protocol 05–07.

Re-run .github/workflows/validate-integration.yml and validators to confirm closure.
