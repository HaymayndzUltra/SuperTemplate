# AI-Driven Workflow Protocol System Evaluation Prompt

## Overview

You are an AI evaluation specialist with extensive experience in assessing AI-driven protocols and developer workflows. I would like you to rigorously test a comprehensive meta-instruction protocol system designed to support the complete software development lifecycle from client discovery to production maintenance.

## Evaluation Scope

### Starting Point: 5 Foundation Protocols

Begin your evaluation with these 5 protocols as the workflow entry point:

1. **00a-client-proposal-generation.md** - Client proposal creation
2. **00B-client-discovery-initiation.md** - Initial client discovery  
3. **01-project-brief-creation.md** - Project brief/PRD creation
4. **00-project-bootstrap-and-context-engineering.md** - Project initialization
5. **00-generate-rules.md** - Cursor rules generation

### Complete Protocol Sequence (28 Total)

From the 5 starting protocols, trace the workflow through all 28 protocols in this sequence:

**Phase 0: Foundation (5)** ‚Üí 00a ‚Üí 00B ‚Üí 01 ‚Üí 00 ‚Üí 00-generate-rules

**Phase 1-2: Planning (3)** ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 6 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 7

**Phase 3: Development (2)** ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 9

**Phase 4: Quality (3)** ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 15 ‚Üí 10

**Phase 5: Deployment (4)** ‚Üí 11 ‚Üí 12 ‚Üí 13 ‚Üí 14

**Phase 6: Closure (5)** ‚Üí 16 ‚Üí 17 ‚Üí 18 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 8

## Evaluation Framework

### 1. Protocol Validation

For each of the 28 protocols, examine:

#### ‚úÖ Completeness Checklist
- [ ] All required sections present (Role, Mission, Workflow, Integration, Quality Gates, Communication, Handoff)
- [ ] Step-by-step execution algorithm defined
- [ ] Prerequisites clearly documented
- [ ] Evidence requirements specified
- [ ] Automation hooks defined
- [ ] Integration points mapped
- [ ] Quality gates with measurable criteria
- [ ] Communication protocols established
- [ ] Handoff checklist complete

#### ‚ùå Gap Identification
- Missing sections or incomplete content
- Unclear or ambiguous instructions
- Missing evidence requirements
- Undefined quality gates
- Missing automation hooks
- Unclear integration points
- Missing communication protocols
- Incomplete handoff procedures

#### üí° Improvement Suggestions
- Specific recommendations for missing content
- Clarity improvements for ambiguous sections
- Integration enhancement suggestions
- Evidence requirement refinements
- Automation opportunity identification
- Communication protocol improvements
- Handoff procedure enhancements

### 2. Integration Validation

#### Handoff Analysis
For each protocol transition, validate:
- **Input Artifacts**: Does Protocol N receive complete inputs from Protocol N-1?
- **Output Artifacts**: Does Protocol N produce all required outputs for Protocol N+1?
- **Quality Gates**: Are quality gates properly enforced at handoff points?
- **Evidence Flow**: Does evidence flow seamlessly between protocols?

#### Dependency Mapping
- Verify all prerequisite dependencies are satisfied
- Check for circular dependencies
- Identify missing dependencies
- Validate dependency ordering

### 3. Scoring Framework

#### Per-Protocol Scoring (1-10 scale)
Each protocol scored across 6 dimensions:

1. **Completeness** (1-10): All sections present, fully detailed
2. **Clarity** (1-10): Easy to understand and follow
3. **Actionability** (1-10): Steps are concrete and executable
4. **Integration** (1-10): Seamless handoffs with adjacent protocols
5. **Evidence** (1-10): Clear, measurable validation criteria
6. **Automation** (1-10): Automation hooks well-defined and executable

**Overall Protocol Score**: Average of 6 dimensions

#### System-Level Scoring
- **Overall Alignment Score**: Percentage of perfect protocol handoffs
- **Coverage Score**: Percentage of SDLC phases covered
- **Completeness Score**: Average of all protocol completeness scores
- **Integration Score**: Average of all protocol integration scores

### 4. Real-world Simulation

Test the protocols under various project scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Simple Project
- Single-page application with basic CRUD
- Minimal external integrations
- Standard deployment pipeline

#### Scenario 2: Medium Complexity Project
- Multi-service architecture
- Database migrations
- CI/CD pipeline with testing

#### Scenario 3: Complex Enterprise Project
- Microservices architecture
- Multiple external integrations
- Advanced monitoring and observability
- Compliance requirements

#### Scenario 4: Crisis Scenario
- Production incident requiring rollback
- Performance degradation
- Security vulnerability

### 5. Reporting Requirements

#### Comprehensive Markdown Report Structure:
