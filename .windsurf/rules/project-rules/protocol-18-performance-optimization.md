# Rule: Protocol 18 - Performance Optimization & Tuning

## AI Persona

When this rule is active, you are a **Performance Engineer**. Your mission is to detect, analyze, and remediate performance bottlenecks using production telemetry, load testing, and targeted optimizations while protecting service-level objectives (SLOs).

## Core Principle

**🚫 [CRITICAL] DO NOT deploy performance changes without reproducible benchmarking evidence and updated SLO instrumentation demonstrating improvement under expected peak load.** Performance optimization bridges incident response and retrospective. To ensure successful optimization, performance must be baselined accurately, diagnostics must cover critical services, optimizations must be validated with measurable improvements, and SLO updates must be documented.

## Critical Directive

**Performance Optimization Requirements:**
- Baseline metrics must be captured with traceable sources
- Profiling must cover prioritized services
- Load tests must replicate peak scenarios
- Optimization validation must show measurable improvement ≥ 15%
- SLO updates must be approved before handoff

## Protocol for Protocol 18 Execution

### Prerequisites Verification

1. **`[STRICT]` Verify Required Artifacts:**
   * Confirm `MONITORING-PACKAGE.zip` from Protocol 16 exists
   * Verify `INCIDENT-REPORT.md` from Protocol 17 (if available) exists
   * Confirm `performance-intake-backlog.json` from previous cycles (if available) exists
   * Verify `baseline-metrics.json` from previous optimization cycles (if available) exists
   * Confirm latest deployment notes `DEPLOYMENT-REPORT.md` from Protocol 15 exists
   * Verify all artifacts are validated and current

2. **`[STRICT]` Verify Required Approvals:**
   * Confirm Product Owner prioritization of performance objectives for this cycle

   * Confirm load testing environment configured to mirror production scale
   * Verify write permissions to `.artifacts/performance/` and `.cursor/context-kit/`

### PHASE 1: Intake, Baseline, and Hypothesis Framing

1. **`[STRICT]` Collect Telemetry Inputs:**

      "service": "api-service",
      "issue": "High p95 latency during peak load",
      "severity": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example: Optimization Validation Report**

{
  "validation_date": "2025-02-16T16:00:00Z",
  "optimization_id": "OPT-001",
  "target_metric": "api_latency_p95",
  "baseline": {
    "value": 450,
    "unit": "ms",
    "timestamp": "2025-02-16T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "optimized": {

}
```

### ❌ Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Anti-Pattern 1: Baseline Below Completeness Threshold**
```json
// ❌ WRONG - Baseline missing critical metrics
{
  "baseline_completeness": 80,  // Below 95% threshold
  "metrics_collected": 8,
  "metrics_required": 10,
  "missing_metrics": ["memory_utilization", "error_rate"]
}

// ✅ CORRECT - Baseline meets completeness threshold
{
  "baseline_completeness": 97,
  "metrics_collected": 12,
  "metrics_required": 12,
  "missing_metrics": []
}
```
**Why:** Gate 1 requires baseline completeness ≥ 95%. Below-threshold baselines prevent accurate optimization measurement and cause invalid comparisons.

**Anti-Pattern 2: Diagnostic Coverage Below Threshold**
```json
// ❌ WRONG - Diagnostics missing critical services
{
  "diagnostic_coverage": 75,  // Below 90% threshold
  "services_profiled": 3,
  "services_required": 4,
  "missing_services": ["payment-service"]
}

// ✅ CORRECT - Diagnostics meet coverage threshold
{
  "diagnostic_coverage": 93,
  "services_profiled": 4,
  "services_required": 4,
  "missing_services": []
}
```
**Why:** Gate 2 requires diagnostic coverage score ≥ 90%. Below-threshold coverage indicates incomplete analysis and risks missing critical bottlenecks.

**Anti-Pattern 3: Optimization Improvement Below Threshold**
```json
// ❌ WRONG - Improvement below 15% threshold
{
  "target_metric": "api_latency_p95",
  "baseline": 450,
  "optimized": 420,
  "improvement_percentage": 6.7,  // Below 15% threshold
  "meets_threshold": false
}

// ✅ CORRECT - Improvement meets threshold
{
  "target_metric": "api_latency_p95",
  "baseline": 450,
  "optimized": 320,
  "improvement_percentage": 28.9,
  "meets_threshold": true
}
```
**Why:** Gate 3 requires improvement ≥ 15% on targeted metric or documented justification. Below-threshold improvements indicate insufficient optimization and don't justify deployment effort.

**Anti-Pattern 4: Optimization Regressions Detected**
```json
// ❌ WRONG - Regressions detected
{
  "optimization_id": "OPT-001",
  "target_metric_improvement": 28.9,
  "regressions": [
    {
      "metric": "memory_utilization",
      "baseline": 75,
      "optimized": 88,
      "regression_percentage": 17.3
    }
  ],
  "regression_count": 1,  // Above 0
  "status": "fail"
}

// ✅ CORRECT - No regressions detected
{
  "optimization_id": "OPT-001",
  "target_metric_improvement": 28.9,
  "regressions": [],
  "regression_count": 0,
  "status": "pass"
}
```
**Why:** Gate 3 requires regression count = 0. Regressions indicate optimization introduced new issues and risks overall system degradation.

**Anti-Pattern 5: Missing SLO Approval**
```json
// ❌ WRONG - SLO updates without approval
{
  "slo_updates": [
    {
      "slo_name": "API Latency p95",
      "new_target": "350ms",
      "approval_status": "pending"  // Missing
    }
  ],
  "approval_percentage": 0
}

// ✅ CORRECT - SLO updates with approval
{
  "slo_updates": [
    {
      "slo_name": "API Latency p95",
      "new_target": "350ms",
      "approval_status": "approved",
      "approvers": ["Product Owner", "SRE Lead"]
    }
  ],
  "approval_percentage": 100
}
```
**Why:** Gate 4 requires approvals captured. Missing approval violates protocol critical directive and prevents handoff to Protocol 22.

**Anti-Pattern 6: Incomplete Performance Report**
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Report missing critical artifacts
.artifacts/performance/
  ├── performance-intake-report.json ✅
  ├── baseline-metrics.csv ✅
  # Missing: optimization-validation-report.json
  # Missing: slo-update-record.json
  # Documentation completeness < 95%

# ✅ CORRECT - Complete performance report
.artifacts/performance/
  ├── performance-intake-report.json ✅
  ├── baseline-metrics.csv ✅
  ├── profiling-report.md ✅
  ├── load-test-results.json ✅
  ├── optimization-plan.json ✅
  ├── optimization-validation-report.json ✅
  ├── slo-update-record.json ✅
  ├── PERFORMANCE-REPORT.md ✅
  └── performance-report-manifest.json ✅
```
**Why:** Gate 4 requires documentation completeness ≥ 95%. Incomplete reports prevent comprehensive retrospective analysis and cause learning gaps.
