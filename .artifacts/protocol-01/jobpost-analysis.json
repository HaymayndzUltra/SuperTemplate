  "goal_summary": "We need an eight-week expert engagement to deliver a production-ready, compliance-audited MVP of a zero-trust payments orchestration layer that is quantum-resistant, regulator-auditable, and resilient across four continents. The outcome must include executable architecture, verified controls, and runbooks that internal teams can operate without external assistance.",
  "objectives": [
    "Launch a pilot-ready orchestration service that:",
    "Handles real-time FX netting, settlement, and reconciliation with dual-ledger traceability.",
    "Implements post-quantum cryptographic handshakes (CRYSTALS-Kyber + Dilithium) for interbank API sessions.",
    "Enforces dynamic least-privilege policies across all microservices and partner integrations.",
    "Provides end-to-end evidence trails for SWIFT CSP, PSD2 RTS, FedLine, and MAS TRM auditors."
  ],
  "deliverables": [
    "Protocolized architecture dossier (threat model, trust boundaries, PQ crypto migration plan, data residency matrix).",
    "Terraform/Pulumi stack definitions with drift detection and compliance guardrails.",
    "Zero-trust policy pack (OPA/Rego + Cedar) with automated test fixtures.",
    "Runbooks: quantum failback, SWIFT CSP audit prep, MAS TRM incident escalation, PQ key rotation.",
    "Evidence manifest: Sigstore attestations, in-toto metadata, FedLine checklist coverage, policy drift dashboards.",
    "Integration test suite proving multi-region failover, sanction rule accuracy, and policy enforcement."
  ],
  "risks": [
    "Clearing partners only accept classic TLS 1.2 today; we must bridge while enforcing PQ viability.",
    "Hardware security modules have 6-week lead times; need interim secure enclave strategy.",
    "Interbank partners reside on-prem with strict firewall rules; must provide zero-trust gateways without exposing core mesh.",
    "Upcoming MAS TRM update may tighten key rotation; expect mid-engagement requirement changes."
  ],
  "compliance_requirements": [
    "All crypto modules must leverage FIPS 140-3 validated libraries; post-quantum suites run behind feature flags with forced downgrade detection.",
    "Zero standing credentials; adopt SPIFFE identities, HashiCorp Vault, and CloudHSM-backed signing for key material.",
    "Multi-region data sovereignty: EU data pinned to eu-west1, APAC data to ap-southeast1, US data to us-east1; cross-border transfers require documented SCC workflows.",
    "SWIFT CSP attestation pack: logging, transaction replay prevention, segregation of duties, and RBAC evidence.",
    "Regulatory change window: MAS TRM 2023 addenda and FedLine security requirements must be reflected in controls catalogue."
  ],
  "performance_targets": [
    "P99 round-trip settlement < 900 ms (excluding external clearing times) with circuit breakers and graceful degradation.",
    "Automated failover between primary and DR regions within 45 seconds, zero data loss.",
    "Real-time policy evaluation latency < 30 ms under 5k TPS sustained load."
  ],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Post-quantum handshake fallback fires alarms within 200 ms and records evidence for regulators.",
    "Least-privilege enforcement confirmed via automated attack simulations (chaos & breach exercises) with audit logs attached.",
    "Data residency validated through synthetic flow tests; any cross-border transfer emits SCC workflow tickets.",
    "FX reconciliation demonstrates penny-perfect accuracy across three currencies and survives region failover tests.",
    "Operational SRE drills (game days) prove recovery procedures for PQ certificate compromise and Kafka partition loss."
  ],
  "submission_requirements": [
    "Concise proposal referencing this scope, highlighting verifiable zero-trust + financial compliance delivery.",
    "Outline of workflow/protocols, quality gates, and evidence packages.",
    "Explicit risk acceptance matrix (what will and will not be assumed within eight weeks).",
    "Links to two proof artifacts: PQ cryptography adoption, regulated payment runbook, or zero-trust implementation.",
    "Availability with timezone overlap across New York, Frankfurt, and Singapore."

  "tone_signals": [
    "Zero-trust architecture depth, PQ migration viability, and regional compliance coverage.",

    "Evidence discipline: traceability, attestations, regulator audit packages.",
    "Risk transparency: clarity on assumptions, blockers, and mitigation pathways.",
    "Communication: direct, regulator-ready documentation tone, alignment with executive steering committee."
