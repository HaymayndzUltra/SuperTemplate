# Session Continuation Instructions
Generated: 2025-01-18T00:10:00Z
Previous Session: manual-run-20250118
Protocol Tested: 01

## What Was Tested
- Protocol: PROTOCOL 01 - Client Proposal Generation (Discovery Compliant)
- Logic Validation: ⚠️ Partial. Workflow executed through drafting and validation, but readability gate failed to meet ≥90 target and structure validator script is missing.
- Gap Detection: Missing project profile artifact, absent structure validator script, automated tone mapper low confidence, readability threshold unmet.
- Error Analysis: NLP dependency installation required (`punkt`), validation script flagged camel-case as grammar issue, continuation generator script absent.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Author or restore `scripts/validate_proposal_structure.py` to satisfy Gate 3 automation expectations.
2. Improve readability metrics by collaborating with documentation specialist; target Flesch score ≥ 90 without sacrificing compliance detail.
3. Backfill `.cursor/context-kit/project-profile.json` or document reason for absence to support discovery continuity.
4. Build or recover `scripts/generate_session_continuation.py` plus session instruction artifacts to honor workflow testing rule.
5. Re-run tone mapper once enhancements implemented to verify confidence ≥ 0.8 or document sustained manual override process.

## Evidence Collected
- `.artifacts/protocol-01/jobpost-analysis.json`
- `.artifacts/protocol-01/tone-map.json`
- `.artifacts/protocol-01/PROPOSAL.md`
- `.artifacts/protocol-01/humanization-log.json`
- `.artifacts/protocol-01/proposal-validation-report.json`
- `.artifacts/protocol-01/proposal-summary.json`
- `.artifacts/protocol-01/reviewer-brief.md`
- `.artifacts/protocol-01/prerequisites-checklist.md`

## Pending Actions Before Handoff
- Resolve readability and validator gaps.
- Run compliance scripts once dependencies confirmed.
- Prepare `[RAY CONFIRMATION REQUIRED]` message post-validation and secure reviewer approval to proceed to Protocol 02.
