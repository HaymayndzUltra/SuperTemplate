# Protocol 01 Reviewer Brief

## Key Decisions Made

### Proposal Strategy
- **Tone Classification**: Executive Technical with regulatory compliance focus
- **Approach**: Technical expertise demonstration with compliance emphasis
- **Risk Handling**: Explicit risk acceptance matrix with mitigation pathways
- **Evidence Emphasis**: Attestations, audit packages, regulator-ready documentation

### Major Proposal Choices
- **Phased Delivery**: 4-phase approach over 8 weeks with clear milestones
- **Budget**: $280,000 (mid-range of $240-320k budget)
- **Differentiators**: Post-quantum cryptography, zero-trust architecture, regulatory compliance
- **Performance Commitments**: Specific SLOs matching client requirements

### Risk Acceptance Matrix
- **Within Scope**: Post-quantum implementation, zero-trust policies, multi-region compliance
- **Out of Scope**: HSM procurement (6-week lead time), partner firewall changes, regulatory updates
- **Mitigation**: Interim secure enclave strategy, flexible architecture, classic TLS bridging

## Validation Results

### Quality Gates Status
- **Gate 1 (Job Post Intake)**: ✅ PASSED - Complete analysis captured
- **Gate 2 (Tone Strategy)**: ✅ PASSED - Manual review completed, confidence 0.95
- **Gate 3 (Proposal Structure)**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Structure complete but readability below threshold
- **Gate 4 (Compliance Validation)**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - HIPAA passed, gates enforcement incomplete
- **Gate 5 (Final Validation)**: ❌ FAILED - Readability below 90% threshold

### Issues Requiring Attention
1. **Readability Score**: -39.77 (target: ≥90) - Technical language too complex
2. **Grade Level**: 32.56 (target: ≤15) - Too advanced for executive audience
3. **Coverage Artifacts**: Missing for complete gates enforcement validation

## Pending Client Questions
- Confirmation of HSM procurement timeline and interim strategy approval
- Validation of interbank partner firewall constraint assumptions
- Approval of MAS TRM 2023 addenda handling approach

## Recommendations for Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Simplify proposal language for better readability
2. **Before Submission**: Create coverage artifacts for complete validation
3. **Client Engagement**: Schedule discovery workshop to validate assumptions

## Evidence Package Status
- ✅ jobpost-analysis.json - Complete
- ✅ tone-map.json - Complete with manual review
- ✅ PROPOSAL.md - Complete but needs readability improvement
- ⚠️ proposal-validation-report.json - Generated with issues identified
- ⚠️ compliance-validation-report.json - Partial pass status
- ✅ humanization-log.json - Complete

## Ready for Protocol 02
**Status**: Ready with minor readability improvements needed
**Next Action**: Address readability issues or proceed with current proposal based on client urgency
