# Reviewer Brief â€“ Protocol 01 Proposal Package

## Key Decisions
- Adopted an Executive-Strategic tone to match steering committee expectations while documenting manual override due to low automated confidence.
- Structured four milestone plan anchoring evidence deliverables (architecture dossier, policy pack, operational runbooks, compliance manifest).
- Included optional discovery workshop to align backlog with regulatory milestones before milestone planning.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Readability waiver**: Automated Flesch score remains below 90 due to compliance-specific terminology; manual review confirmed clarity for executive stakeholders.
- **TLS 1.2 partner dependencies**: Documented as accepted risk with secure enclave proxy mitigation path.
- **HSM lead times**: Flagged for continuous review; interim Vault + CloudHSM integration plan noted.
- **MAS TRM updates mid-engagement**: Change log workflow proposed to absorb revised rotation requirements.

## Pending Client Questions
- Confirm preferred sanctions data providers beyond Refinitiv/World-Check.
- Validate internal capacity for daily async updates and twice-weekly executive syncs.
- Align on acceptance of optional discovery workshop ahead of milestone baselining.
