# Reviewer Brief: Protocol 01 - Client Proposal Generation

## Key Decisions
- Adopted executive-technical tone classification via manual override after automation confidence of 0.17 failed threshold.
- Structured proposal around three delivery tracks (trust fabric, policy engine, observability) to align with compliance-heavy scope.
- Committed to four sprint cadence with evidence-backed milestones to mirror client's expectation for regulator-ready outputs.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Readability score (19.35) < required 90**: Current validator reports low score due to dense regulatory language; mitigation is to explore plain-language refinements without losing compliance specificity.
- **Factual score reported as 0.0**: Validator lacks integrated evidence linkage; manual cross-check performed to ensure statements remain capability-aligned and non-fabricated.
- **Missing contextual artifacts**: `.cursor/context-kit/project-profile.json` not present; flagged as input gap for discovery team.
- **Automation gap**: `scripts/validate_proposal_structure.py` referenced in protocol but absent in repository; documented for remediation in governance backlog.

## Pending Questions for Client
1. Confirm availability of PQ cryptography proof artifacts acceptable for sharing in the proposal package.
2. Validate preferred tooling for evidence manifest storage (e.g., in-toto registry, internal GRC system).
3. Align on risk acceptance boundaries for TLS 1.2 bridging during interim period.

## Next Actions Before Handoff
- Review readability concerns with documentation specialist for potential simplifications.
- Coordinate with governance team to implement or replace missing structure validator script.
- Once validation adjustments are resolved, prepare `[RAY CONFIRMATION REQUIRED]` message and await approval to trigger Protocol 02.
