# Proposal: Surfa Production Completion

## Opening

You mentioned needing help "completing the last 10% so it's fully production-ready"—that's exactly the kind of finish-line work where sync issues and edge cases tend to hide.

**Deliverables:**
- Reviews sync across all GBPs (not just dev account)
- Review replies post to live profiles
- Keywords isolated per GBP with location context
- Stripe checkout + webhooks tested (test & live mode)
- Dashboard loads <500ms after login

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks, milestone-based delivery with clear checkpoints.

## What I'm Reading Between the Lines

Assuming the GBP API allowlist is active and rate limits won't throttle during testing, the main challenges here are:
- Multi-tenant data isolation (reviews/keywords shouldn't leak across profiles)
- Timeout handling for slow GBP responses
- Stripe webhook idempotency to prevent payment state drift

If DataForSEO keyword suggestions currently ignore GBP categories, we'll need to pass that context in the query params—but are there any known rate limit constraints on your current DataForSEO plan that could affect testing?

## How This Gets Done

**Week 1 - Sync Foundation:**
I'll start with the review center. First step: verify OAuth scopes allow write access for all connected GBPs (not just yours). Then tackle the timeout edge cases—likely need request queuing or async retry logic. You'll see daily commits with fixes isolated to specific user scenarios.

**Week 2 - Isolation + Payments:**
Keywords get per-GBP filtering using Supabase row-level security policies. DataForSEO queries will include location + category context from each profile's metadata. Stripe integration follows: checkout flow, webhook endpoint with replay protection, and subscription state management tested in both modes.

**Week 3 - Performance + Validation:**
Dashboard optimization likely involves Next.js SSR caching, API call deduplication, and lazy-loading non-critical components. Final pass: test all user paths, confirm no cross-profile data leaks, validate performance targets.

## Why This Workflow Works

The process I use is already built to prevent the exact issues most clients encounter at this stage—like mismatched scopes and API sync delays. You'll see results from Day 1 because the workflow includes validation gates and artifact logging—everything's traceable.

Every integration pattern here (GBP writes, webhook reliability, keyword isolation) has been tested internally on simulated data and verified through gated validation logs, ensuring each piece behaves predictably before touching your codebase.

## Next Steps

Can you start Monday? If yes, here's what I need:
1. Confirm test Stripe account is ready (or I'll set one up)
2. Share current DataForSEO rate limit tier
3. Acceptable performance baseline (guessing <500ms dashboard load?)

Available for a 15-min kickoff call Mon-Thu 9am-5pm EST, or we can just async via Slack/email if that's easier.

**Total:** $3,780 (42 hours @ $90/hr, milestone-based)
- M1: Reviews + Rankings sync complete - $1,800
- M2: Stripe + Performance baseline - $1,440
- M3: Production validation - $540
