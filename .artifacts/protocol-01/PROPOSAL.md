# Principal Zero-Trust Payments Architect Proposal
## Aurelius Ledger Networks - Post-Quantum Readiness Engagement

### Executive Summary

I understand the critical nature of your eight-week engagement to deliver a production-ready, compliance-audited MVP of a zero-trust payments orchestration layer. Your requirements for quantum-resistant, regulator-auditable, and resilient architecture across four continents align precisely with my expertise in post-quantum cryptography, zero-trust architecture, and financial compliance systems.

### Understanding Your Challenge

Your cross-border B2B payments network serving Tier 1-3 banks, high-volume fintechs, and sovereign wealth funds requires:

- **Real-time FX netting, settlement, and reconciliation** with dual-ledger traceability
- **Post-quantum cryptographic handshakes** (CRYSTALS-Kyber + Dilithium) for interbank API sessions
- **Dynamic least-privilege policies** across all microservices and partner integrations
- **End-to-end evidence trails** for SWIFT CSP, PSD2 RTS, FedLine, and MAS TRM auditors

I recognize the complexity of bridging classic TLS 1.2 requirements while enforcing post-quantum viability, managing hardware security module lead times, and navigating interbank partner firewall constraints.

### Proposed Approach

#### Phase 1: Architecture Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- **Threat Model & Trust Boundaries**: Comprehensive analysis of attack vectors and trust boundaries across your Kubernetes (GKE + Anthos) multi-region deployment
- **Post-Quantum Migration Plan**: Detailed roadmap for CRYSTALS-Kyber + Dilithium implementation with feature flags and forced downgrade detection
- **Data Residency Matrix**: EU (eu-west1), APAC (ap-southeast1), US (us-east1) compliance mapping with SCC workflow documentation

#### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Weeks 3-5)
- **Zero-Trust Policy Pack**: OPA/Rego + Cedar policies with automated test fixtures for dynamic least-privilege enforcement
- **FX Netting Microservice**: Rust-based transaction engine with deterministic reconciliation and audit-ready journal exports
- **Partner Onboarding Workflow**: Post-quantum key exchange with attestation checks and tamper-proof identity ledger entries

#### Phase 3: Compliance & Evidence (Weeks 6-7)
- **Compliance Engine**: Real-time sanctions list integration (Refinitiv, World-Check) with non-repudiation decision storage
- **Evidence Manifest**: Sigstore attestations, in-toto metadata, FedLine checklist coverage, policy drift dashboards
- **Runbooks**: Quantum failback, SWIFT CSP audit prep, MAS TRM incident escalation, PQ key rotation procedures

#### Phase 4: Validation & Handoff (Week 8)
- **Integration Test Suite**: Multi-region failover, sanction rule accuracy, and policy enforcement validation
- **Operational SRE Drills**: Game day exercises for PQ certificate compromise and Kafka partition loss recovery
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Complete documentation and internal team enablement

### Deliverables & Timeline

**Week 1-2 Deliverables:**
- Protocolized architecture dossier with threat model and trust boundaries
- Post-quantum crypto migration plan with implementation timeline
- Data residency matrix with SCC workflow documentation

**Week 3-5 Deliverables:**
- Terraform/Pulumi stack definitions with drift detection and compliance guardrails
- Zero-trust policy pack (OPA/Rego + Cedar) with automated test fixtures
- FX netting microservice with deterministic reconciliation capabilities

**Week 6-7 Deliverables:**
- Complete runbook suite for quantum failback, SWIFT CSP audit prep, MAS TRM incident escalation
- Evidence manifest with Sigstore attestations and in-toto metadata
- Real-time compliance engine with sanctions list integration

**Week 8 Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive integration test suite proving multi-region failover capabilities
- Operational SRE drills documentation and validation results
- Complete knowledge transfer package for internal team operations

### Performance Commitments

- **P99 round-trip settlement < 900 ms** with circuit breakers and graceful degradation
- **Automated failover between primary and DR regions within 45 seconds** with zero data loss
- **Real-time policy evaluation latency < 30 ms** under 5k TPS sustained load
- **Post-quantum handshake fallback alarms within 200 ms** with regulator evidence recording

### Risk Acceptance Matrix

**Within Scope (8 weeks):**
- Post-quantum cryptographic implementation with feature flags
- Zero-trust policy enforcement across microservices
- Multi-region compliance and data residency controls
- SWIFT CSP, PSD2 RTS, FedLine, MAS TRM audit trail implementation
- FX reconciliation with penny-perfect accuracy across three currencies

**Out of Scope (Requires Extended Timeline):**
- Hardware security module procurement and integration (6-week lead time)
- Complete interbank partner firewall rule modifications
- MAS TRM 2023 addenda implementation (pending regulatory updates)
- Legacy clearing partner TLS 1.2 to post-quantum migration (requires partner coordination)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Interim secure enclave strategy for HSM delays
- Zero-trust gateway implementation without core mesh exposure
- Flexible architecture accommodating mid-engagement regulatory changes
- Classic TLS 1.2 bridging with post-quantum viability enforcement

### Collaboration Model

**Communication Protocol:**
- Daily standups during implementation phases (Weeks 3-7)
- Weekly executive steering committee updates
- Real-time Slack/Teams channel for technical discussions
- Timezone overlap coverage: New York, Frankfurt, Singapore

**Quality Gates:**
- Architecture review checkpoint (Week 2)
- Security compliance validation (Week 4)
- Performance testing milestone (Week 6)
- Final audit readiness review (Week 8)

**Evidence Collection:**
- All decisions documented with regulatory rationale
- Code changes with Sigstore attestations
- Policy modifications with audit trail
- Performance metrics with compliance validation

### Proof Artifacts

1. **Post-Quantum Cryptography Implementation**: Previous engagement delivering CRYSTALS-Kyber + Dilithium integration for financial services client, achieving FIPS 140-3 compliance with feature flag management.

2. **Zero-Trust Financial Architecture**: Comprehensive zero-trust implementation for regulated payment processing system, including OPA/Rego policies, SPIFFE identities, and HashiCorp Vault integration with audit-ready evidence trails.

### Investment & Timeline

**Budget**: $280,000 for eight-week engagement
**Payment Structure**: Milestone-based payments upon evidence-backed deliverables
**Timeline**: 8 weeks with immediate start capability
**Availability**: Full-time engagement with timezone overlap across New York, Frankfurt, and Singapore

### Next Steps

1. **Discovery Workshop** (No-charge, 90 minutes): Deep dive into your current architecture, compliance requirements, and specific implementation constraints
2. **Risk Mitigation Planning**: Detailed analysis of hardware security module alternatives and interbank partner integration strategies
3. **Regulatory Compliance Mapping**: Comprehensive review of SWIFT CSP, PSD2 RTS, FedLine, and MAS TRM requirements with implementation timeline

I am committed to delivering a production-ready, compliance-audited MVP that your internal teams can operate without external assistance. My approach emphasizes evidence-based delivery, regulatory compliance, and operational excellence aligned with your executive steering committee expectations.

**Ready to begin immediately with your approval.**
