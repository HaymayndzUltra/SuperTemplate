# Proposal: Double-Sided Marketplace MVP

Hey Nik,

I'm not gonna lie—1-2 weeks is tight for a marketplace MVP, but here's how we can make it work. You need user auth, listings, search, messaging, payments, and profiles—the full stack. I'd deliver a functional MVP in 2-3 weeks that handles 1000 users, using Claude AI to accelerate development while keeping everything transparent for your daily reviews.

**What I'm hearing:**
- You need speed, but "functional" needs definition. If we're talking core features (listings, search, basic payments), that's doable. If you want reviews, ratings, advanced filtering—that pushes us to 3-4 weeks.
- Daily code reviews are fine—I'm comfortable with transparency. What's the turnaround time on reviews? That'll help me plan velocity.
- You mentioned drawing inspiration from a similar app. Which one? That'll help me nail the feature set without guessing.

**Here's my approach:**
Week 1: Foundation (auth, profiles, basic listings). Week 2: Core marketplace (search, filtering, messaging). Week 3: Payments, admin dashboard, load testing for 1000 users. I'll use Claude AI for rapid prototyping, but every feature gets tested before moving on. Your friend's daily reviews? Perfect—I'll structure commits so they're easy to review in 30-minute chunks.

The workflow I use is already built to prevent the exact issues most clients hit at this stage—like scope mismatches and integration delays. You'll see results from Day 1 because the process includes validation gates and artifact logging. Everything's traceable. Every integration gets tested internally before touching your codebase.

I've built similar marketplace MVPs using AI-assisted workflows, and the transparency you want? That's how I operate anyway. Daily standups, clear commits, no surprises.

**Next step:** Let's jump on that video call. I'm available today or tomorrow. We can discuss timeline reality, define "functional" clearly, and I can show you exactly how the AI workflow accelerates development without cutting corners.

What time works for you?
