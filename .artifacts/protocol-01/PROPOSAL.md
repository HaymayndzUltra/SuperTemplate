# Greeting

Aurelius Ledger Networks team,

Thank you for inviting a focused, eight-week engagement to advance the zero-trust payments orchestration layer. I appreciate the direct, regulator-ready tone in your post and will match it with clear commitments backed by verifiable evidence. My background leading cross-border settlement platforms for regulated institutions aligns with your requirement for a production-ready, compliance-audited MVP spanning New York, Frankfurt, and Singapore time zones. I maintain active collaboration windows overlapping UTC-4 to UTC+8 and am comfortable driving executive briefings as well as deep dives with security, compliance, and SRE peers. Most importantly, every milestone I deliver ties to documented controls, Sigstore-signed artefacts, and audit logs that your internal teams can operate independently after handoff, keeping autonomy front and center once the engagement completes.

# Understanding

Your objective is to stand up a pilot-ready orchestration service that combines zero-trust rigor, post-quantum resilience, and regulator-auditable evidence, without sacrificing the latency tolerances demanded by modern FX corridors. The MVP must orchestrate policy-driven routing, deterministic FX netting, partner onboarding with CRYSTALS-Kyber and Dilithium handshakes, and a compliance engine that records irreversible sanctions decisions. The work must respect multi-region sovereignty boundaries, ensure least-privilege enforcement across Istio, SPIRE, and Vault, and supply MAS TRM, FedLine, PSD2 RTS, and SWIFT CSP evidence packages. Success is measured not only by working software but by traceable controls, recovery drills, and runbooks that empower your teams to run game days, simulate PQ certificate compromise, and prove penny-perfect reconciliation even during failover between Anthos regions. We will also validate alignment with your GitHub Actions provenance policies and secure sign-off from internal audit leads before development sprints lock scope.

# Proposed Approach

Week 1 focuses on rapid discovery with your architecture, compliance, and operations stakeholders. We will review existing Terraform and Pulumi baselines, inventory cryptographic modules for FIPS 140-3 validation, and map current mesh identities to SPIFFE assertions. Using our internal compliance accelerator, I will bootstrap an evidence ledger that stores Sigstore attestations, in-toto metadata, and SCC approvals per region. Weeks 2 and 3 shift to building the policy-driven orchestration engine in Rust and Go, weaving in Cedar and OPA guardrails plus dynamic risk scoring against Refinitiv feeds. Parallel work sets up a feature-flagged PQ handshake path that can downgrade gracefully when counterparties remain on TLS 1.2. Weeks 4 and 5 emphasize integration testing—chaos drills for Kafka partitions, latency profiling to stay within 30 ms policy evaluation, and multi-region failover rehearsals targeting 45-second RTO. Weeks 6 through 8 harden compliance artefacts, finalize runbooks, and conduct regulator-style tabletop reviews.

# Deliverables & Timeline

I propose four evidence-backed milestones. **Milestone 1 (end of week 2)** delivers the validated architecture dossier covering trust boundaries, PQ migration sequencing, and data residency matrices aligned to SCC obligations. **Milestone 2 (end of week 4)** ships the orchestration engine with deterministic FX reconciliation, SPIFFE-integrated access plane, and automated policy tests logged via GitHub Actions provenance chains. **Milestone 3 (end of week 6)** provides the full zero-trust policy pack, sanctions engine fixtures, and integration test suite proving multi-region failover, attack simulation outputs, and least-privilege enforcement telemetry. **Milestone 4 (end of week 8)** hands over the operational runbooks, MAS TRM and FedLine checklists, Sigstore-signed evidence manifest, and a recorded executive readout summarizing risk acceptance boundaries, outstanding assumptions, and next-phase recommendations for scaling beyond the pilot footprint.

# Collaboration Model

Engagement governance centers on transparent, automation-first rituals. We will open a shared evidence workspace populated nightly with compliance artefacts, Grafana exports, and attestation metadata so your internal audit team can review progress asynchronously. Weekly steering sessions align with the executive committee, while twice-weekly technical syncs focus on resolving integration blockers across Istio gateways, Vault policies, and CockroachDB survivability tests. I will maintain a living risk register that categorizes constraints like HSM lead times, partner firewall limitations, and MAS TRM change windows, tagging each with mitigation owners and decision deadlines. All code and infrastructure changes flow through signed pull requests with in-toto provenance, and game day drills will include your SOC counterparts to ensure muscle memory before go-live. Documentation remains regulator-ready from day one to avoid late-stage rewrites.

# Next Steps

To move forward, I recommend a 60-minute alignment workshop with architecture, compliance, and payments operations leads. In that session we will confirm scope boundaries, identify existing proof artefacts to reference, and finalize the risk acceptance matrix—explicitly stating which legacy controls remain out of scope during the eight-week sprint. Following approval, I will circulate a milestone contract detailing deliverables, evidence checkpoints, and payment triggers aligned to your milestone-based budget. I will also provision a secure workspace for sharing Sigstore keys, policy packs, and tabletop exercise results. Once we ratify responsibilities and escalation channels, execution can begin immediately with discovery interviews scheduled within the first forty-eight hours to preserve the eight-week delivery runway. I will prepare an initial differentiator matrix referencing prior zero-trust rollouts and circulate two tabletop exercise windows so executive sponsors can confirm availability without delaying kickoff.
