# Proposal: FastAPI + OpenAI Integration Support

Hey there,

You're looking for help integrating OpenAI APIs with FastAPI and setting up Stripe billing. I can commit 25+ hours/week during Pakistan Standard Time for the 1-2 month timeline.

## What I'm hearing

- **OpenAI API integration** with FastAPI backend—handling calls, error management, and response parsing.
- **Stripe webhook testing** is a priority, suggesting you're launching billing or troubleshooting flows.
- **Daily collaboration** via Discord + GitHub matters most.
- If we're talking health-tech, I'd want to clarify HIPAA considerations early—assuming that's relevant.

## How I'd approach this

Week 1-2: Set up OpenAI integration with error handling and retry logic. I'll create validation schemas and structured logging for quick debugging.

Week 3-4: Build Stripe webhook handler, test against Stripe's test mode, and create local testing setup.

Week 5-6: Clean up edge cases, improve logging tools, and document everything. You'll have a solid integration ready to scale.

The workflow I use already includes validation gates for API integrations and webhook testing. You'll see results from Day 1 because everything's traceable—each integration behaves predictably before touching production.

I've worked with FastAPI + OpenAI before and I'm comfortable with the debugging patterns you'll need.

## Next steps

Can we jump on a quick call this week? I'm free during Pakistan Standard Time evenings. Otherwise, happy to start with async questions via Discord.
