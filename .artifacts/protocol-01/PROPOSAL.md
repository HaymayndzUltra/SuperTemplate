# Proposal: Zero-Trust Payments Orchestration MVP

## Greeting
Aurelius Ledger Networks team,

Thank you for outlining such a precise, regulator-facing mandate. Your clarity around PQ migration, evidence requirements, and regional sovereignty reads like a steering committee brief, and it deserves a partner who respects that rigor. I am approaching this engagement with the same disciplined mindset your auditors will apply: every control mapped, every decision evidenced, and every risk surfaced early. Over the next eight weeks I will work as an embedded architecture lead who keeps executive stakeholders, security officers, and regional compliance counterparts aligned in real time. My focus is to make the path to a production-grade, quantum-resilient orchestration layer feel direct, traceable, and defensible so that you can hold the line with regulators and internal governance simultaneously. I appreciate the opportunity to co-create that outcome with you.

## Understanding
Your goal is to field a zero-trust payments orchestration layer that survives regulator scrutiny without slowing high-volume corridors. The scope spans real-time FX settlement, PQ cryptographic handshakes, dynamic least-privilege enforcement, and auditable evidence packs across SWIFT CSP, PSD2, Fed Line, and MAS TRM. The operating environment crosses GKE + Anthos regions, Istio with SPIRE-backed identities, Kafka eventing, and a dual data layer of Cockroach DB with AWS QLDB notarization. You have explicit SLOs (<900 ms settlement, <30 ms policy evaluation, 45-second failover) and the expectation that every deliverable is backed by runbooks, attestations, and in-toto provenance. Risks include bridging legacy TLS 1.2 partners into PQ readiness, hardware security module lead times, on-prem partner constraints, and regulatory changes mid-stream. Success looks like a pilot-ready service with a transparent risk acceptance matrix that your internal teams can operate without external dependency.

## Proposed Approach
Week zero begins with a compliance-first discovery sprint: validating assumptions against JOB-POST.md, confirming stakeholder availability across New York, Frankfurt, and Singapore, and hardening the evidence plan so every control ties to an auditor-readable artifact. From there the work splits into three parallel tracks. Track A designs the PQ-ready trust fabric: SPIFFE-based identity issuance, Kyber/Dilithium handshake pathways, and fallback logic with downgrade alarms inside 200 ms. Track B engineers the policy-driven orchestration engine, implementing deterministic FX netting, Cedar/OPA policy packs, and sanctions integrations with traceable non-repudiation. Track C builds the observability and governance layer, wiring Open Telemetry pipelines, Sigstore attestations, and SCC-triggered workflows for cross-border flows. Each track feeds a unified threat model and evidence manifest maintained in repository-native automation workflows powered by Actions with in-toto provenance. Daily async updates keep engineering aligned, while twice-weekly executive briefings focus on compliance posture and milestone readiness.

## Deliverables & Timeline
The eight-week delivery timeline is structured into four two-week increments, each closing with evidence-backed milestones. Sprint 1 produces the protocolized architecture dossier, including trust boundaries, PQ migration decision matrix, and data residency blueprint validated with synthetic flow tests. Sprint 2 delivers Terraform and Pulumi stacks with enforced guardrails, SPIFFE/Vault integrations, and automated drift detection results. Sprint 3 packages the zero-trust policy suite, deterministic FX reconciliation engine, and integration harnesses for sanctions and audit logging, complete with chaos drill results to confirm least-privilege enforcement. Sprint 4 focuses on operational readiness: runbooks for quantum failback, SWIFT CSP, MAS TRM, and Fed Line, plus the comprehensive evidence manifest with Sigstore attestations, in-toto metadata, and policy drift dashboards. Each sprint closes with recorded demos, artifact walkthroughs, and a risk update aligned to your acceptance matrix.

## Collaboration Model
I will operate as an embedded architecture and delivery lead with structured touchpoints tuned to your distributed leadership cadence. Daily async status drops capture control health, blocker escalation, and next actions. Twice-weekly cross-region working sessions dig into architecture and policy details with platform, security, and compliance leads. Weekly executive readouts summarize posture, decision logs, and evidence coverage for steering committee review. All artifacts, infrastructure as code, and policy packs live in version-controlled repositories with mandatory peer review workflows. Security-sensitive exchanges route through your Vault and Cloud HSM boundaries; no standing credentials are stored outside the mesh. I will maintain a living risk acceptance register, document mitigation ownership, and confirm sign-offs before advancing gates. My goal is to make collaboration feel predictable, audit-ready, and respectful of the global time zones your teams inhabit.

## Next Steps
To move forward, we can schedule a 60-minute technical diligence session early next week aligned to New York morning / Singapore evening. Agenda: validate scope assumptions, confirm available evidence repositories, align on PQ feature-flag rollout, and agree on the risk acceptance matrix format. I will also share a template for the compliance validation suite so your internal teams can co-author controls from day one. Following that session, you will receive a refined execution plan, final milestone commitments, and an optional complimentary discovery workshop focused on telemetry baselining and regulator narrative prep. Once approved, we lock sprint ceremonies, establish secure access paths, and begin the week-zero discovery sprint with auditors, SRE leads, and policy owners present. Please let me know preferred times and any pre-read requirements so I can tailor materials accordingly.

## Optional Discovery Workshop
- **Outcome:** Co-design telemetry baselines and evidence narratives mapped to SWIFT CSP, MAS TRM, Fed Line, and PSD2 audits.
- **Duration:** 90 minutes, no charge.
- **Participants:** Platform engineering, security governance, compliance leads.
- **Deliverable:** Prioritized backlog of instrumentation and evidence checkpoints ready for implementation in Sprint 1.
