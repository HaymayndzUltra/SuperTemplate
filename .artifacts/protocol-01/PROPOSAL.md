# Client Proposal - Protocol 01

## Greeting
Aurora Ledger Networks team,

Thank you for outlining such a transparent, regulator-ready vision. I appreciate how clearly you framed the zero-trust, post-quantum, and audit priorities; that clarity makes it easier to stay aligned with executive and compliance expectations. Over the past few hours I combed through your scope, compliance references, and the risks around TLS compatibility, hardware lead times, and evolving MAS TRM guidance. This proposal mirrors that homework while leaving room for fast adjustment if a regulator or steering committee member raises new constraints. I want our collaboration to feel like an extension of your control tower—steady communication, transparent assumptions, and documentation that decision-makers can trust instantly. I also noted your emphasis on empowering internal teams without ongoing external help, so knowledge transfer and regulator-friendly documentation will remain front and center from day one.



## Understanding
You’re seeking an 8-week engagement that culminates in a production-ready zero-trust payments orchestration MVP. Success hinges on provable controls: post-quantum handshakes (Kyber/Dilithium), dual-ledger reconciliation, OPA/Cedar policy enforcement, and evidence packs that satisfy SWIFT CSP, PSD2 RTS, Fed Line, and MAS TRM review. Architecture must respect multi-region sovereignty—eu-west1, ap-southeast1, us-east1—and hit p99 settlement under 900 ms with automated failover inside 45 seconds. Key risks include bridging partners who only accept TLS 1.2, securing Cloud HSM capacity, and absorbing regulatory updates mid-flight. Your budget window of $240k–$320k reinforces the need to deliver measurable control readiness without scope drift. Acceptance gates such as attack simulations, SCC ticket automation, PQ fallback alarms, and SRE drills highlight that operational proof is as critical as the code itself.



## Proposed Approach
I propose a phased execution that balances rapid orchestration delivery with controlled compliance evidence. Week 1 concentrates on joint discovery and control mapping: confirm assumptions, lock the risk acceptance matrix, and align MAS TRM/Fed Line checklists with our backlog. Weeks 2-3 build the core platform—Terraform/Pulumi baseline, multi-region network topology, and SPIFFE/Vault identity issuance. Parallel threads prepare the zero-trust gateways for TLS 1.2 partners while feature-flagging PQ handshakes. Weeks 4-5 extend policy enforcement: OPA/Rego suites, Cedar authorizations, automated attack simulations, and Sigstore attestation wiring. Weeks 6-7 focus on runbooks, SRE drills, and cross-region failover rehearsals. Week 8 is dedicated to validation sprints: evidence manifest consolidation, regulator-style documentation reviews, and stakeholder walkthroughs. Throughout, we’ll maintain traceable decision logs and ensure each gate is backed by reproducible scripts.

## Deliverables
Each sprint is anchored to tangible evidence so the steering committee always sees bank-ready artifacts. The opening sprint delivers the architecture dossier: threat models, trust boundaries, a post-quantum migration roadmap, and a data residency matrix aligned to eu-west1, ap-southeast1, and us-east1 guardrails. Alongside that, you receive Terraform and Pulumi blueprints with drift detection, SPIFFE identity issuance templates, and Vault policy scaffolding. The next wave expands deliverables to include zero-trust ingress gateways for TLS 1.2 partners, dual-ledger settlement workflows with reconciliation scripts, and OPA/Rego plus Cedar policy packs with automated regression fixtures. Later sprints package Sigstore-backed evidence manifests, quantum failback runbooks, MAS TRM escalation guides, SCC ticket automation workflows, and a library of SRE drill playbooks so your teams can operate confidently after handoff.

## Timeline
Week 1 focuses on discovery, assumption validation, and calibrating the risk acceptance matrix while we align MAS TRM, SWIFT CSP, PSD2, and Fed Line checklists with the backlog. Weeks 2-3 emphasize platform foundations: deploy Terraform/Pulumi stacks, wire multi-region networking, and configure identity, secrets, and zero-trust ingress with safe TLS 1.2 bridging. Weeks 4-5 shift toward control hardening—standing up OPA/Rego enforcement, Cedar authorizations, chaos experiments, evidence capture pipelines, and PQ handshake toggles. Weeks 6-7 rotate into operations readiness through tabletop exercises, SRE game days, quantum failback drills, and meticulous runbook drafting. Week 8 consolidates validation by finalizing the risk matrix, hosting recorded demos, packaging regulator-ready evidence, and securing sign-offs. Every sprint closes with async updates, daily decision logs, and Friday steering summaries.



## Collaboration Model
Given the global footprint (New York, Frankfurt, Singapore), I recommend anchoring twice-weekly checkpoints with rolling async updates. Day-to-day coordination can stay in your preferred channel; I’ll maintain a living decision log plus evidence tracker so every control has traceability. Weekly demos will spotlight the latest policy enforcement results, failover rehearsals, and compliance documentation. I’ll work closely with your internal teams to orchestrate SRE game days and ensure handoffs align with their on-call realities. Any blocker—like Cloud HSM supply delays—will trigger an immediate mitigation review with options documented for executive sign-off. Transparency is non-negotiable: you’ll see burndown metrics, gate status, and assumptions the moment they shift. If a regulatory change arrives mid-stream, we adjust priorities together rather than forcing surprises at the end.

## Next Steps
Schedule a complimentary 60-minute workshop to review the risk acceptance matrix, confirm evidence expectations, and map compliance accelerators in motion. The conversation keeps kickoff decisions aligned and clarifies documentation preferences before resources are committed. Afterward I will finalize the implementation schedule, publish a draft backlog, and flag runbooks or policy packs that need early review. Share windows overlapping New York, Frankfurt, and Singapore along with proof artifacts you want highlighted for executive stakeholders. Once the start date is locked, I will circulate a protocol checklist covering validation scripts, attestation pipelines, and readiness reviews so progress stays visible. Weekly executive recaps and a living log of assumptions, risks, and approvals will keep governance transparent. Workshop notes arrive within 24 hours.
