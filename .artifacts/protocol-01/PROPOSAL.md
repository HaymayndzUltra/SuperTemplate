Proposal: Double-Sided Marketplace SaaS MVP

Hey Nik,

I saw your post about needing a double-sided marketplace MVP in 1-2 weeks. You mentioned you're "okay with sacrificing quality/perfectness to achieve your timeline but the app must be functional for at least 1000 users"—that's actually a smart constraint. I've built similar MVPs using AI-assisted development, and I'm comfortable with daily code reviews.

What I'm hearing:
- Functional MVP for 1000 users, not perfection
- Daily standups and external code reviews required
- Drawing 99% inspiration from a similar app (which one, by the way?)
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks max

My approach:
Week 1, I'd focus on core marketplace architecture—user auth, listings, double-sided flow. Week 2, I'd build frontend, integrate payments, deploy. I'm assuming Stripe for payments, but we should confirm. The workflow I use prevents the exact issues most clients encounter—mismatched scopes, API sync delays. You'll see results from Day 1 because the process includes validation gates and artifact logging. Everything's traceable.

I've worked with Claude and AI coding tools extensively, so I'm efficient with that workflow. I'm also totally fine with daily reviews—transparency makes projects move faster.

**Milestones & Deliverables:**

**Week 1 - Core Backend ($1,575):**
- User authentication (signup, login, password reset)
- User profiles (buyer/seller roles)
- Product/service listing creation (CRUD)
- Basic search and filtering
- Database schema and API endpoints
- Basic messaging system between users

**Week 2 - Frontend & Payments ($1,350):**
- Responsive frontend interface
- Payment integration (Stripe/PayPal)
- Order/transaction management
- Real-time notifications
- Production deployment
- Performance optimization for 1000+ users

**Final - Testing & Validation ($225):**
- Load testing for 1000 concurrent users
- Bug fixes and final polish

**Total: $3,150** (70 hours @ $45/hr)

**Next step:**
Can we jump on a call today or tomorrow? I'm available most afternoons EST. I'd love to clarify the reference app and confirm core MVP features before we start.
