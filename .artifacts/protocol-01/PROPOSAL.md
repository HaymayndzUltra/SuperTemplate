# Proposal – Zero-Trust Payments Orchestration

## Greeting
Aurelius Ledger Networks team,

Thank you for sharing such a clear outline of the zero-trust orchestration layer you need; I appreciate the level of detail you provided. I hear and understand the urgency around regulator-ready evidence, MAS TRM updates, and the expectation that your engineers run solo after eight weeks. My role in this engagement is to keep delivery calm, predictable, and transparent while we navigate the high-stakes nature of cross-border settlement. I will keep communication direct, recap every decision in plain language, and surface risks the moment they appear. The combination of Anthos, Istio, Kafka, CockroachDB, and Cloudflare Workers is demanding, yet your documentation already sets a strong foundation. I will respect that preparation, invite feedback from compliance owners, and move at the cadence your steering committee expects. When questions surface I will answer them quickly and make sure every stakeholder leaves each touchpoint with the same understanding of scope and evidence.

## Understanding
Your target MVP must operate across four continents, coordinate deterministic FX netting, and prove compliance for SWIFT CSP, PSD2 RTS, FedLine, and MAS TRM. The orchestration service needs post-quantum handshakes, zero standing credentials, SPIFFE identities, Vault-controlled secrets, and CloudHSM-backed signing. Every decision has to leave an evidence trail for auditors and withstand latency targets like sub-900 ms settlement and 45-second regional failover. I also recognize the friction points: partners still on TLS 1.2, long hardware security module lead times, and pending MAS TRM guidance that could change key rotation schedules without warning. The sanctions workflow must integrate providers such as Refinitiv and World-Check while keeping non-repudiation intact. Documenting these details from day one keeps the scope honest and protects the eight-week milestone plan.

## Proposed Approach
Week one focuses on alignment. I will review current Kubernetes workloads, Istio policies, and Kafka schemas to map how the zero-trust policies should wrap around them. We will lock the threat model, PQ feature flag strategy, and downgrade detection plan before coding starts. Weeks two through four deliver the orchestration core. Tasks include policy-driven routing rules, FX netting invariants, sanctions provider adapters, and deterministic journaling across CockroachDB and AWS QLDB. In parallel I will build Sigstore and in-toto pipelines so evidence accumulates automatically. Weeks five through seven emphasize validation. We will run chaos drills on least-privilege enforcement, synthetic data residency exercises, and recovery walk-throughs for PQ certificate incidents. Week eight packages everything into regulator-ready briefings, SCC workflow guides, and runbooks that your teams can operate without outside help.

## Deliverables & Timeline
I propose four milestones, each with evidence bundles:

- **Milestone One (end of week two):** Updated architecture dossier, trust boundaries, PQ migration playbook, downgrade alert tests.
- **Milestone Two (end of week four):** Terraform and Pulumi baselines with guardrails, zero-trust policy packs for OPA/Rego and Cedar, automated tests showing policy enforcement at 5k TPS.
- **Milestone Three (end of week six):** Operational runbooks for quantum failback, SWIFT CSP prep, MAS TRM escalation, FedLine checklist coverage, plus multi-region failover tests demonstrating <45 second recovery.
- **Milestone Four (end of week eight):** Evidence manifest with Sigstore attestations, in-toto metadata, SCC ticket automation, and executive readouts suitable for the steering committee.

Each milestone concludes with a written risk review so assumptions and blockers are visible.

## Collaboration Model
I will operate as an embedded partner with daily async updates and two executive syncs every week timed for New York, Frankfurt, and Singapore overlap. Work will flow through a shared kanban board categorized by compliance domain so stakeholders can spot progress at a glance. Risk registers will document TLS bridge constraints, HSM delivery dependencies, and zero-trust gateway needs for on-prem partners. During testing we will pair with SRE and compliance owners to run tabletop exercises on PQ key compromise, Kafka partition loss, and sanctions engine outages. Observability data from OpenTelemetry and Prometheus will be shared openly. All documentation, meeting notes, and decision logs will carry the regulator-ready tone you requested, and every artifact will include traceability back to requirements and controls.

## Next Steps
If this structure fits your expectations, I recommend a 90-minute kickoff to confirm acceptance criteria, align on evidence templates, and set milestone payment checkpoints within the $240–320k budget. Ahead of the call I will provide two proof artifacts: a zero-trust implementation playbook and a regulated payment operations runbook. During kickoff we will lock the risk acceptance matrix, list items that stay outside scope (for example, full partner TLS upgrades), and agree on interim mitigations like secure enclave proxies. Once approved I will provision the project workspace, enable Sigstore and in-toto tooling, and schedule the first steering committee touchpoint. Please share your preferred kickoff window; I can cover EST, CET, and SGT overlap without issue. I will also share a short checklist after the kickoff so every team knows who owns each artifact, when reviews occur, and how questions should be routed. That checklist will sit beside the kanban board so there is no ambiguity about next actions.

### Optional Discovery Workshop
- Outcome: Align backlog with regulatory milestones and payment corridor priorities.
- Duration: 90 minutes (no-charge), scheduled before milestone planning.
