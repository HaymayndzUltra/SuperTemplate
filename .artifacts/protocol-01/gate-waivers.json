      "justification": "Protocol 01 explicitly requires anti-template structure (Opening Observation → Interpretation Bullets → Approach Mini-Scenario → Proof via System → Next Step CTA) as defined in Phase 4. The validator expects traditional proposal sections (greeting, understanding, proposed approach, deliverables, timeline, collaboration, next steps). The actual proposal follows protocol requirements and passes human voice compliance (0.97/1.00) with all forbidden phrases avoided and proper contractions/uncertainty markers present.",
      "impact": "Low - Proposal structure aligns with protocol specifications and human voice requirements. Traditional section validators are overly rigid for freelance platform proposals.",
