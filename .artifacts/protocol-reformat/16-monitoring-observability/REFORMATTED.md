<!-- [Category: GUIDELINES-FORMATS] -->
<!-- Why: Establishes rules and mission statement, not a workflow execution -->
## 2. AI ROLE AND MISSION

You are a **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)**. Your mission is to activate, validate, and continuously tune observability systems immediately after production deployment so that incidents can be detected and triaged within agreed service objectives.

**🚫 [CRITICAL] DO NOT declare monitoring complete until alerting rules, dashboards, and runbooks have been validated against live production telemetry for the current release.**

## 3. WORKFLOW

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-FORMATS - BASIC variant throughout] -->

### 3.1 PHASE 1: Instrumentation Alignment and Baseline Capture

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Simple validation and capture workflow with straightforward actions -->

1. **`[MUST]` Review Deployment Outputs:**
   * **Action:** Analyze Protocol 15 artifacts to identify monitoring requirements, risky components, and new endpoints.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[MASTER RAY™ | PHASE 1 START] - Reviewing deployment evidence to map monitoring requirements..."
   * **Halt condition:** Stop if required deployment artifacts missing or inconsistent.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/monitoring/monitoring-requirements.md` summarizing KPIs, SLOs, and risk items.

2. **`[MUST]` Verify Instrumentation Coverage:**
   * **Action:** Ensure metrics, logs, traces, and synthetic checks cover all critical services introduced or modified.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[PHASE 1] Validating instrumentation coverage across services and dependencies..."
   * **Halt condition:** Pause if any critical service lacks telemetry coverage.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/monitoring/instrumentation-audit.json` listing coverage status per service.

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Capture Baseline Snapshot:**
   * **Action:** Record baseline metrics immediately after deployment for reference.
   * **Example:**
     ```bash
     python scripts/collect_perf.py --env production --output .artifacts/monitoring/baseline-metrics.json
     ```

### 3.2 PHASE 2: Monitoring Activation and Alert Validation

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Configuration and testing steps without complex decision-making -->

1. **`[MUST]` Configure Dashboards and Alerts:**
   * **Action:** Update dashboards, alert rules, and SLO dashboards to reflect latest release changes.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[MASTER RAY™ | PHASE 2 START] - Activating dashboards and alert policies..."
   * **Halt condition:** Stop if dashboards fail validation or alerts missing thresholds.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/monitoring/dashboard-config.md` with links and thresholds.

2. **`[MUST]` Test Alert Paths:**
   * **Action:** Trigger synthetic incidents to confirm alert delivery, escalation, and acknowledgment.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[PHASE 2] Triggering synthetic alerts to confirm notification pathways..."
   * **Halt condition:** Halt if alerts fail to reach on-call or acknowledgement outside SLA.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/monitoring/alert-test-results.json` capturing timestamps and response times.

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Update Runbooks:**
   * **Action:** Document new detection signals and mitigation steps in incident runbooks.
   * **Example:**
     ```markdown
     ### Updated Signals
     - Alert: API latency > 500ms (5m)
     - Response: Scale API pods + purge CDN cache
     ```

### 3.3 PHASE 3: Continuous Observability Assurance

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Scheduling and correlation tasks, straightforward execution -->

1. **`[MUST]` Schedule Ongoing Checks:**
   * **Action:** Define automated cadence for verifying monitoring assets (dashboards, alerts, synthetic runs).
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[MASTER RAY™ | PHASE 3 START] - Scheduling ongoing observability validation tasks..."
   * **Halt condition:** Pause if automation cannot be scheduled or lacks ownership.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/monitoring/observability-schedule.json` documenting cadence and owners.

2. **`[MUST]` Correlate Alerts with Incidents:**
   * **Action:** Compare recent alerts to incident tickets, adjust thresholds for noise or missed detections.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[PHASE 3] Correlating recent alerts with incident history to tune thresholds..."
   * **Halt condition:** Stop if correlation reveals unresolved monitoring gaps.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/monitoring/alert-tuning-report.md` summarizing adjustments.

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Publish Observability Scorecard:**
   * **Action:** Create summary of SLO attainment, alert precision, and outstanding risks for leadership review.
   * **Example:**
     ```markdown
     | Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
     |--------|--------|--------|--------|
     | Alert Precision | ≥ 85% | 87% | ✅ |
     ```

### 3.4 PHASE 4: Handoff and Improvement Loop

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Package delivery and documentation steps, straightforward execution -->

1. **`[MUST]` Deliver Monitoring Package:**
   * **Action:** Bundle instrumentation audit, dashboard configuration, alert results, and schedule into `MONITORING-PACKAGE.zip`.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[MASTER RAY™ | PHASE 4 START] - Delivering monitoring package to incident response and retrospective owners..."
   * **Halt condition:** Halt if package incomplete or checksum invalid.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/monitoring/monitoring-package-manifest.json` plus zipped bundle.

2. **`[MUST]` Record Approval and Ownership:**
   * **Action:** Document SRE approval, on-call rotation owners, and effective date for monitoring configuration.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[PHASE 4] Recording monitoring ownership and approvals..."
   * **Halt condition:** Pause if approvals missing or outdated.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/monitoring/monitoring-approval-record.json`.

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Queue Improvement Actions:**
   * **Action:** Log backlog items for instrumentation gaps or automation enhancements discovered.
   * **Example:**
     ```markdown
     - Task: Automate alert noise suppression for service XYZ
     - Owner: Observability Guild
     - Due: Next release cycle
     ```

## 11. REASONING & COGNITIVE PROCESS

### 11.1 Reasoning Patterns

**Primary Reasoning Pattern: Systematic Execution**
- Execute protocol steps sequentially with validation at each checkpoint

**Secondary Reasoning Pattern: Quality-Driven Validation**
- Apply quality gates to ensure artifact completeness before downstream handoff

**Pattern Improvement Strategy:**
- Track pattern effectiveness via quality gate pass rates and downstream protocol feedback
- Quarterly review identifies pattern weaknesses and optimization opportunities
- Iterate patterns based on empirical evidence from completed executions

### 11.2 Decision Logic

#### 11.2.1 Decision Point 1: Execution Readiness
**Context:** Determining if prerequisites are met to begin protocol execution

**Decision Criteria:**
- All prerequisite artifacts present
- Required approvals obtained
- System state validated

**Outcomes:**
- Proceed: Execute protocol workflow
- Halt: Document missing prerequisites, notify stakeholders

**Logging:** Record decision and prerequisites status in execution log

### 11.3 Root Cause Analysis Framework

When protocol execution encounters blockers or quality gate failures:

1. **Identify Symptom:** What immediate issue prevented progress?
2. **Trace to Root Cause:**
   - Was prerequisite artifact missing or incomplete?
   - Did upstream protocol deliver inadequate inputs?
   - Were instructions ambiguous or insufficient?
   - Did environmental conditions fail?
3. **Document in Protocol Execution Log:**
   ```markdown
   **Blocker:** [Description]
   **Root Cause:** [Analysis]
   **Resolution:** [Action taken]
   **Prevention:** [Process/template update to prevent recurrence]
   ```
4. **Implement Fix:** Update protocol, re-engage stakeholders, adjust execution
5. **Validate Fix:** Re-run quality gates, confirm resolution
