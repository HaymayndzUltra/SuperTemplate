- **Reasoning:** Multiple interconnected substeps for test execution and defect tracking
- **Content Preserved:** 3 actions, 1 communication message, 3 evidence requirements, 1 halt condition

#### STEP 4: Evidence Packaging & Sign-Off
- **Format Applied:** EXECUTION-BASIC
- **Reasoning:** Sequential packaging and approval steps without complex decisions
- **Content Preserved:** 3 actions, 1 communication message, 3 evidence requirements, 1 halt condition

### QUALITY GATES Section
- **Format Applied:** GUIDELINES-FORMATS (Gates)
- **Reasoning:** Defines validation criteria, thresholds, and automated enforcement rules
- **Content Preserved:** 4 gates with criteria, evidence, pass thresholds, failure handling, and automation commands

### COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS Section
