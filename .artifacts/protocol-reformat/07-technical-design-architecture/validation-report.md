# Validation Report for Protocol 07: Technical Design & Architecture

## Content Preservation Validation

| Element Type | Original Count | Reformatted Count | Status |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Evidence references (`**Evidence:**`) | 8 | 34 | ✅ Expanded to match explicit EXECUTION format; original artifact paths retained |
| Script references (`scripts/`) | 13 | 13 | ✅ Preserved |
| Artifact paths (`.artifacts/`) | 28 | 32 | ✅ Preserved (additional lines reuse existing paths) |
| Compliance markers (`[STRICT]`) | 1 | 8 | ✅ Converted original mandatory checklists to `[STRICT]` directives |
| Compliance markers (`[MUST]`) | 9 | 27 | ✅ Converted actionable tasks to `[MUST]` markers |
| Compliance markers (`[GUIDELINE]`) | 4 | 9 | ✅ Converted advisory notes to `[GUIDELINE]` markers |
| Reasoning blocks (`[REASONING]`) | 0 | 2 | ✅ Added explicit reasoning wrappers around existing decision content |
| Quality gates | 4 | 4 | ✅ Preserved |

## Format Application Validation

- EXECUTION-REASONING applied to architecture decomposition; premises, alternatives, decisions, and risks documented.
- EXECUTION-BASIC applied to remaining workflow steps and automation hooks with Action/Evidence/Validation triads.
- GUIDELINES-FORMATS used for prerequisites, role definition, integration points, quality gates, communication, evidence summary.
- META-FORMATS used for reflection and reasoning sections with continuous improvement directives.
- Section headers renumbered with `##`/`###` hierarchy and annotated with category comments.

## Diff Review Summary

- Structural modifications include converting checklists to `[MUST]/[GUIDELINE]`, adding reasoning wrappers, and normalizing numbering.
- All original scripts, artifact references, communication snippets, and gate criteria remain verbatim.
- Added evidence rows reflect existing requirements broken into explicit substeps; no new artifacts introduced.

## Conclusion

✅ **Result:** Reformatted protocol preserves all original material and satisfies category-based formatting requirements with explicit reasoning coverage.
