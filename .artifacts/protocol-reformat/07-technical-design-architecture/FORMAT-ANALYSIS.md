#### STEP 3: Specification Packaging & Validation
<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Direct packaging and validation actions. -->
- **Content Preserved:** Design package assembly, compliance validation, implementation roadmap

#### STEP 4: Approval & Handoff Preparation
<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Linear approval workflow culminating in downstream handoff. -->
- **Content Preserved:** Review scheduling, task generation inputs, archive manifest

### 4. REFLECTION & LEARNING
<!-- [Category: META-FORMATS] -->
<!-- Why: Captures retrospectives, improvement tracking, and system evolution. -->
- **Format Applied:** META-FORMATS
- **Content Preserved:** Retrospective guidance, improvement cadence, system evolution, knowledge capture, roadmap planning

### 5. INTEGRATION POINTS
<!-- [Category: GUIDELINES-FORMATS] -->
<!-- Why: Defines upstream dependencies, downstream consumers, and storage standards. -->
- **Format Applied:** GUIDELINES-FORMATS
- **Content Preserved:** Inputs from Protocol 06 and discovery, outputs to Protocol 08 and implementation teams, repository paths

### 6. QUALITY GATES
<!-- [Category: GUIDELINES-FORMATS] -->
<!-- Why: Sets validation criteria, thresholds, and automation triggers. -->
- **Format Applied:** GUIDELINES-FORMATS
- **Content Preserved:** Four gates (Source Alignment, Architecture Integrity, Validation Coverage, Handoff Readiness)

### 7. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS
<!-- [Category: GUIDELINES-FORMATS] -->
<!-- Why: Standardizes status, validation, and failure messaging. -->
- **Format Applied:** GUIDELINES-FORMATS
- **Content Preserved:** Phase announcements, validation prompt, failure escalation macro

### 8. AUTOMATION HOOKS
<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Executes discrete validation scripts and CI workflows. -->
- **Format Applied:** EXECUTION-BASIC
- **Content Preserved:** Script commands, CI/CD job, manual fallback checklist

### 9. HANDOFF CHECKLIST
<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Sequential completion checks before downstream transition. -->
- **Format Applied:** EXECUTION-BASIC
- **Content Preserved:** Continuous improvement validation, pre-handoff verification, trigger for Protocol 08

### 10. EVIDENCE SUMMARY
<!-- [Category: GUIDELINES-FORMATS] -->
<!-- Why: Normalizes artifact inventory, traceability, and quality metrics. -->
- **Format Applied:** GUIDELINES-FORMATS
- **Content Preserved:** Artifact catalog, traceability matrix, KPI table

### 11. REASONING & COGNITIVE PROCESS
<!-- [Category: META-FORMATS] -->
<!-- Why: Documents reasoning patterns, decision logic, and meta-cognition routines. -->
- **Format Applied:** META-FORMATS
- **Content Preserved:** Two reasoning blocks, design decision logic, root-cause workflow, learning mechanisms, self-awareness

## Content Preservation Summary

- **Sections Analyzed:** 11
- **Formats Applied:**
  - GUIDELINES-FORMATS: 6 sections
  - EXECUTION-BASIC: 3 workflow steps + 3 supporting sections
  - EXECUTION-REASONING: 1 workflow step (Step 2)
  - META-FORMATS: 2 sections
- **Key Element Counts:**
  - Reasoning Blocks: 2 preserved and annotated
  - Decision Points: 1 maintained within architecture decomposition
  - Evidence Requirements: 34 explicit `**Evidence:**` entries (all original references retained)
  - Script References: 8 unique automation hooks retained
