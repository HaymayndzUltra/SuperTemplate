# Format Analysis for Protocol 20 - Project Closure & Handover

## Section-by-Section Format Choices

### PREREQUISITES
- **Format Applied:** GUIDELINES-FORMATS (implicit baseline)
- **Reasoning:** Existing checklist already satisfied strict prerequisite guidance without requiring structural changes.
- **Content Preserved:** Artifact lists, approvals, system state requirements.

### WORKFLOW
- **Format Applied:** EXECUTION-FORMATS - BASIC variant (per phase)
- **Reasoning:** Each phase executes discrete closure activities with clear halt conditions and evidence capture, without branching decisions requiring REASONING or nested substeps.
- **Content Preserved:** All actions, communications, halt conditions, evidence references, and illustrative examples.

### REFLECTION & LEARNING
- **Format Applied:** META-FORMATS - Retrospective synthesis
- **Reasoning:** Section provides retrospective prompts and continuous improvement framing, aligning with meta-analysis guidance.
- **Content Preserved:** Retrospective timing, participants, agenda, continuous improvement and system evolution guidance.

### INTEGRATION POINTS / QUALITY GATES / COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS
- **Format Applied:** GUIDELINES-FORMATS
- **Reasoning:** These sections codify standards and reference material needed for execution traceability, quality validation, and communications.
- **Content Preserved:** All dependency mappings, gate criteria, automation commands, messaging templates, and error handling language.

### HANDOFF CHECKLIST
- **Format Applied:** EXECUTION-FORMATS - BASIC variant
- **Reasoning:** Checklist enforces completion validation before handing off to Protocol 21 and therefore benefits from explicit execution framing.
- **Content Preserved:** Continuous improvement validation items, pre-handoff checks, downstream trigger instructions, and evidence package details.

### EVIDENCE SUMMARY & REASONING & COGNITIVE PROCESS
- **Format Applied:** META-FORMATS - Evidence inventory and cognitive explainability
- **Reasoning:** Sections aggregate artifacts, traceability, metrics, and reasoning frameworks, matching meta-format expectations.
- **Content Preserved:** Artifact tables, traceability matrix, metrics, reasoning patterns, decision logic, learning mechanisms, and adaptation processes.
