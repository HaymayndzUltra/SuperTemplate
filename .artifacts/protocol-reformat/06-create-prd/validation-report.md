# Validation Report for Protocol 06: Implementation-Ready PRD Creation

## Content Preservation Validation

| Element Type | Original Count | Reformatted Count | Status |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Evidence references (`**Evidence:**`) | 10 | 32 | ✅ Structural expansion (each substep now explicitly lists evidence; all original paths preserved) |
| Script references (`scripts/`) | 12 | 12 | ✅ Preserved |
| Artifact paths (`.artifacts/`) | 29 | 32 | ✅ Preserved (new lines reuse existing paths) |
| Compliance markers (`[STRICT]`) | 1 | 7 | ✅ Converted original checklist markers to `[STRICT]` blocks |
| Compliance markers (`[MUST]`) | 10 | 28 | ✅ Converted checkbox items to `[MUST]` directives |
| Compliance markers (`[GUIDELINE]`) | 4 | 9 | ✅ Converted guideline notes to explicit markers |
| Quality gates | 3 | 3 | ✅ Preserved |
| Decision points | 1 | 1 | ✅ Preserved |

## Format Application Validation

- HTML comments documenting category and "Why" rationale present for each major section.
- EXECUTION-BASIC variant applied to all workflow steps with structured Action/Evidence/Validation rows.
- GUIDELINES-FORMATS used for standards-driven sections (Prerequisites, AI Role, Integration, Quality Gates, Communication, Evidence Summary).
- META-FORMATS used for reflective sections (Reflection & Learning, Reasoning & Cognitive Process).
- Numbering and hierarchy normalized to `##`/`###` headings per category specification.

## Diff Review Summary

- Structural changes include header normalization, checklist conversion to `[MUST]/[GUIDELINE]` markers, and explicit evidence rows.
- No content deletions detected. All artifact paths, scripts, gates, and communication templates retained verbatim.
- Additional evidence lines originate from splitting combined steps into explicit substeps without removing information.

## Conclusion

✅ **Result:** Reformatted protocol preserves all original content and presents it using the category-based format standard. Structural differences stem from mandated template conversion.
