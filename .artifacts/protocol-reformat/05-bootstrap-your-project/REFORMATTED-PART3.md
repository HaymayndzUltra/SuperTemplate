## REASONING & COGNITIVE PROCESS
<!-- [Category: META-FORMATS] -->
<!-- Why: Meta-level protocol analysis and reasoning patterns documentation -->

### Reasoning Patterns

#### Primary Pattern: Systematic Execution
- **Approach:** Sequential protocol execution with validation checkpoints
- **Validation:** Quality gates at each major phase transition
- **Evidence:** Comprehensive artifact generation for traceability

#### Secondary Pattern: Quality-Driven Validation
- **Approach:** Multi-layered quality assurance through automated and manual gates
- **Validation:** Threshold-based pass/fail criteria with clear remediation paths
- **Evidence:** Detailed validation reports for each gate

#### Pattern Improvement Strategy

- **Review Cadence:** Quarterly pattern effectiveness assessment
- **Iteration Process:** Evidence-based pattern refinement from execution data

### Decision Logic

#### Decision Point 1: Execution Readiness
**Context:** Determining if prerequisites are met to begin protocol execution

**Decision Criteria:**
- All prerequisite artifacts present and valid
- Required approvals obtained and documented
- System state validated and healthy

**Outcomes:**
- **Proceed:** Execute protocol workflow with full automation
- **Halt:** Document missing prerequisites, notify stakeholders, await resolution

**Logging:** Record decision rationale and prerequisites status in execution log

#### Decision Point 2: Protocol Handoff Selection
**Context:** Choosing between Protocol 02 (standard) or Protocol 24 (alternate) for discovery

**Decision Criteria:**
- Client relationship status (new vs. existing)
- Project methodology preference (waterfall vs. agile)
- Process requirements (formal vs. lean)

**Outcomes:**
- **Protocol 02:** Standard comprehensive discovery process
- **Protocol 24:** Alternate quick discovery process

**Logging:** Document selection rationale in handoff checklist

### Root Cause Analysis Framework

When protocol execution encounters blockers or quality gate failures:

1. **Identify Symptom:**
   - What immediate issue prevented progress?
   - Which quality gate or step failed?
   - What error messages or indicators appeared?

2. **Trace to Root Cause:**
   - Was prerequisite artifact missing or incomplete?
   - Did upstream protocol deliver inadequate inputs?
   - Were instructions ambiguous or insufficient?
   - Did environmental conditions fail?
   - Was user approval delayed or denied?

3. **Document in Protocol Execution Log:**
   ```markdown
   **Blocker:** [Description of blocking issue]
   **Root Cause:** [Analysis of underlying cause]
   **Resolution:** [Action taken to resolve]
   **Prevention:** [Process/template update to prevent recurrence]
   ```

4. **Implement Fix:**
   - Update protocol documentation if needed
   - Re-engage stakeholders for missing inputs
   - Adjust execution parameters
   - Resolve environmental issues

5. **Validate Fix:**
   - Re-run failed quality gates
   - Confirm resolution with evidence
   - Document lessons learned
