# Format Analysis for Protocol 22 - Implementation Retrospective

## Section-by-Section Format Choices

### PREREQUISITES
- **Format Applied:** GUIDELINES-FORMATS (implicit checklist)
- **Reasoning:** Existing checklist already conveyed strict prerequisites for artifacts, approvals, and system readiness.
- **Content Preserved:** All artifact, approval, and system state requirements.

### WORKFLOW
- **Format Applied:** EXECUTION-FORMATS - BASIC variant (per phase)
- **Reasoning:** Each phase executes linear retrospective facilitation activities with defined halt conditions and evidence capture.
- **Content Preserved:** Actions, communications, halt conditions, evidence references, and illustrative examples.

### REFLECTION & LEARNING
- **Format Applied:** META-FORMATS - Retrospective synthesis
- **Reasoning:** Section supplies structured learning capture guidance consistent with meta-analysis expectations.
- **Content Preserved:** Retrospective agenda, continuous improvement tracking, system evolution, knowledge capture, and future planning directives.

### INTEGRATION POINTS / QUALITY GATES / COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS
- **Format Applied:** GUIDELINES-FORMATS
- **Reasoning:** These sections define dependency mappings, gate criteria, automation commands, and messaging frameworks.
- **Content Preserved:** All inputs/outputs, gate definitions, automation hooks, communication templates, and error handling language.

### HANDOFF CHECKLIST
- **Format Applied:** EXECUTION-FORMATS - BASIC variant
- **Reasoning:** Checklist ensures readiness for Protocol 23; execution framing underscores evidence requirements.
- **Content Preserved:** Continuous improvement validations, pre-handoff checks, evidence package description, and trigger instructions.

### EVIDENCE SUMMARY & REASONING & COGNITIVE PROCESS
- **Format Applied:** META-FORMATS - Evidence inventory and cognitive explainability
- **Reasoning:** Sections aggregate artifacts, traceability, metrics, reasoning frameworks, and adaptation mechanisms.
- **Content Preserved:** Artifact tables, traceability matrix, metrics, reasoning patterns, decision logic, learning mechanisms, and meta-cognition guidance.
