# Validation Report for Protocol 09: Environment Setup & Validation

## Content Preservation Validation

| Element Type | Original Count | Reformatted Count | Status |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Evidence references (`**Evidence:**`) | 8 | 32 | ✅ Expanded per EXECUTION format; original artifact paths preserved |
| Script references (`scripts/`) | 15 | 15 | ✅ Preserved |
| Artifact paths (`.artifacts/`) | 27 | 31 | ✅ Preserved (no new storage locations introduced) |
| Compliance markers (`[STRICT]`) | 2 | 8 | ✅ Converted mandatory checklist items to `[STRICT]` directives |
| Compliance markers (`[MUST]`) | 10 | 29 | ✅ Converted actionable instructions to `[MUST]` markers |
| Compliance markers (`[GUIDELINE]`) | 4 | 9 | ✅ Converted advisory statements to `[GUIDELINE]` markers |
| Decision points | 1 | 1 | ✅ Preserved |
| Quality gates | 4 | 4 | ✅ Preserved |

## Format Application Validation

- EXECUTION-BASIC applied across all workflow steps with explicit Action/Evidence/Validation lines.
- GUIDELINES-FORMATS used for prerequisites, role definition, integration points, quality gates, communication, evidence summary.
- META-FORMATS used for reflection and reasoning sections.
- Category comments and "Why" rationale present for every section.

## Diff Review Summary

- Structural updates normalize headings, convert checklists to `[MUST]/[GUIDELINE]`, and expand evidence rows.
- All automation commands, artifact paths, gate criteria, and communication templates preserved verbatim.
- Additional evidence rows represent explicit formatting of pre-existing requirements; no content loss detected.

## Conclusion

✅ **Result:** Reformatted protocol retains complete content and satisfies category-based structural standards for environment setup validation.
