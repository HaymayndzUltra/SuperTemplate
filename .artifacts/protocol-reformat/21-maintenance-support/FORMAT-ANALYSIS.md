# Format Analysis for Protocol 21 - Continuous Maintenance & Support Planning

## Section-by-Section Format Choices

### PREREQUISITES
- **Format Applied:** GUIDELINES-FORMATS (implicit checklist)
- **Reasoning:** Existing prerequisite structure already satisfied requirements for artifacts, approvals, and system state definitions.
- **Content Preserved:** Artifact lists, approvals, and system readiness checks.

### WORKFLOW
- **Format Applied:** EXECUTION-FORMATS - BASIC variant (per phase)
- **Reasoning:** Each phase executes linear maintenance planning tasks with halt conditions and evidence capture; no complex decision branching required.
- **Content Preserved:** All actions, communications, halt conditions, evidence references, and illustrative examples.

### REFLECTION & LEARNING
- **Format Applied:** META-FORMATS - Retrospective synthesis
- **Reasoning:** Section focuses on structured retrospectives and continuous improvement loops.
- **Content Preserved:** Retrospective agenda, continuous improvement tracking, system evolution, knowledge capture, and future planning directives.

### INTEGRATION POINTS / QUALITY GATES / COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS
- **Format Applied:** GUIDELINES-FORMATS
- **Reasoning:** Sections codify dependency mappings, validation criteria, automation commands, messaging templates, and error handling protocols.
- **Content Preserved:** All upstream/downstream mappings, gate definitions, automation hooks, communication templates, and fallback procedures.

### HANDOFF CHECKLIST
- **Format Applied:** EXECUTION-FORMATS - BASIC variant
- **Reasoning:** Checklist ensures readiness before transitioning to Protocol 22; execution framing highlights evidence expectations.
- **Content Preserved:** Continuous improvement validations, pre-handoff checks, evidence package summary, and trigger instructions.

### EVIDENCE SUMMARY & REASONING & COGNITIVE PROCESS
- **Format Applied:** META-FORMATS - Evidence inventory and cognitive explainability
- **Reasoning:** Sections aggregate artifacts, traceability, metrics, reasoning frameworks, decision logic, and adaptive learning mechanisms.
- **Content Preserved:** Artifact tables, traceability matrix, metrics, reasoning patterns, decision logic, learning mechanisms, and meta-cognition guidance.
