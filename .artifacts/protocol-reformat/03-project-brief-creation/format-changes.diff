-### STEP 1: Discovery Validation
+### PHASE 1: Discovery Validation
+<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
+<!-- Why: Simple workflow steps for validating discovery artifacts -->
 
 1. **`[MUST]` Audit Required Artifacts:**
    * **Action:** Confirm discovery artifacts exist, contain approved content, and align with accepted proposal commitments; log results in `project-brief-validation-report.json`.
-   * **Communication:** 
-     > "[MASTER RAYâ„¢ | PHASE 1 START] - Auditing discovery artifacts for completeness and alignment."
-   * **Halt condition:** Stop if any artifact is missing, empty, or lacks approval evidence.
    * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-03/project-brief-validation-report.json`
+   * **Validation:** All required artifacts present with validation score â‰¥ 0.95.
+   
+   **Communication:** 
+   > "[MASTER RAYâ„¢ | PHASE 1 START] - Auditing discovery artifacts for completeness and alignment."
+   
+   **Halt condition:** Stop if any artifact is missing, empty, or lacks approval evidence.
 
 2. **`[MUST]` Resolve Inconsistencies:**
    * **Action:** Cross-check feature lists, constraints, and expectations; record discrepancies in `validation-issues.md` and resolve with stakeholders before proceeding.
-   * **Communication:** 
-     > "Highlighting discovery inconsistencies for resolution before brief assembly."
    * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-03/validation-issues.md`
+   * **Validation:** All discrepancies documented and resolved or waived.
+   
+   **Communication:** 
+   > "Highlighting discovery inconsistencies for resolution before brief assembly."
 
 3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Capture Context Summary:**
    * **Action:** Summarize client goals, audience, and success metrics in `context-summary.md` for quick reference.
-   * **Example:**
-     ```markdown
-     **Client Goals**
-     - Reduce onboarding time from 7 days to 2 days
-     - Support 10k MAU within first quarter
-     ```
+   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-03/context-summary.md`
+   * **Validation:** Summary includes goals, audience, and at least 2 success metrics.
+   
+   **Example (DO):**
+   ```markdown
+   **Client Goals**
+   - Reduce onboarding time from 7 days to 2 days
