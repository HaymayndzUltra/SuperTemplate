## 10. EVIDENCE SUMMARY
<!-- [Category: GUIDELINES-FORMATS] -->
<!-- Why: Defining standards for evidence collection and quality metrics -->

### Learning and Improvement Mechanisms

**[STRICT]** All artifacts must generate feedback for continuous improvement:

**Feedback Collection:** All artifacts generate feedback for continuous improvement. Quality gate outcomes tracked in historical logs for pattern analysis and threshold calibration.

**Improvement Tracking:** Protocol execution metrics monitored quarterly. Template evolution logged with before/after comparisons. Knowledge base updated after every 5 executions.

**Knowledge Integration:** Execution patterns cataloged in institutional knowledge base. Best practices documented and shared across teams. Common blockers maintained with proven resolutions.

**Adaptation:** Protocol adapts based on project context (complexity, domain, constraints). Quality gate thresholds adjust dynamically based on risk tolerance. Workflow optimizations applied based on historical efficiency data.

### Generated Artifacts:

**[STRICT]** The following artifacts must be generated and validated:

| Artifact | Location | Purpose | Consumer | Verification Owner |
|----------|----------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| `project-brief-validation-report.json` | `.artifacts/protocol-03/` | Proof of discovery alignment | Protocol 04 | Solutions Architect |
| `PROJECT-BRIEF.md` | `.artifacts/protocol-03/` | Authoritative brief | Protocols 04 & 06 | Product Owner |
| `traceability-map.json` | `.artifacts/protocol-03/` | Source linkage for brief content | Protocol 06 | Technical Lead |
| `BRIEF-APPROVAL-RECORD.json` | `.artifacts/protocol-03/` | Approval evidence | Protocol 04 | Account Manager |
| `technical-baseline.json` | `.artifacts/protocol-03/` | Technical summary for design | Protocol 06 | Technical Lead |
| `validation-issues.md` | `.artifacts/protocol-03/` | Discrepancy documentation | Internal | Solutions Architect |
| `context-summary.md` | `.artifacts/protocol-03/` | Quick reference context | Internal | Product Owner |
| `brief-structure-report.json` | `.artifacts/protocol-03/` | Structural validation results | CI/CD | Automation |

### Traceability Matrix

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- Input artifacts inherit from: Protocol 01, Protocol 02
- Configuration dependencies: `.templates/briefs/`, `scripts/script-registry.json`
- External dependencies: None

**Downstream Consumers:**
- Output artifacts consumed by: Protocol 04, Protocol 06
- Shared artifacts: `PROJECT-BRIEF.md`, `technical-baseline.json`
- Archive requirements: 7-year retention per compliance

**Verification Chain:**
- Each artifact includes: SHA-256 checksum, timestamp, verified_by field
- Verification procedure: Run validation scripts for each quality gate
- Audit trail: All artifact modifications logged in protocol execution log

### Quality Metrics:

**[STRICT]** Track and maintain the following quality metrics:

| Metric | Target | Baseline | Current | Status | Trend |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| Gate 1 Pass Rate | ≥ 95% | [TBD] | [TBD] | ⏳ Pending | - |
| Gate 2 Pass Rate | ≥ 95% | [TBD] | [TBD] | ⏳ Pending | - |
| Gate 3 Pass Rate | ≥ 95% | [TBD] | [TBD] | ⏳ Pending | - |
| Evidence Completeness | 100% | [TBD] | [TBD] | ⏳ Pending | - |
| Integration Integrity | 100% | [TBD] | [TBD] | ⏳ Pending | - |
| Brief Assembly Time (hours) | ≤ 4 | [TBD] | [TBD] | ⏳ Pending | - |
| Approval Collection Time (days) | ≤ 2 | [TBD] | [TBD] | ⏳ Pending | - |

## 11. REASONING & COGNITIVE PROCESS
<!-- [Category: META-FORMATS] -->
<!-- Why: Meta-level protocol analysis and reasoning patterns documentation -->

### Reasoning Patterns

#### Primary Reasoning Pattern: Systematic Execution
- Execute protocol steps sequentially with validation at each checkpoint
- Ensure each step builds on validated outputs from previous steps
- Pattern ensures completeness and traceability

#### Secondary Reasoning Pattern: Quality-Driven Validation
- Apply quality gates to ensure artifact completeness before downstream handoff
- Validate both content and structure of deliverables
- Pattern prevents propagation of errors to dependent protocols

#### Pattern Improvement Strategy:
- Track pattern effectiveness via quality gate pass rates and downstream protocol feedback
- Quarterly review identifies pattern weaknesses and optimization opportunities
- Iterate patterns based on empirical evidence from completed executions

### Decision Logic

#### Decision Point 1: Execution Readiness
**Context:** Determining if prerequisites are met to begin protocol execution

**Decision Criteria:**
- All prerequisite artifacts present → Proceed
- Required approvals obtained → Proceed
- System state validated → Proceed
- Any prerequisite missing → Halt

**Outcomes:**
- **Proceed:** Execute protocol workflow starting with Phase 1
- **Halt:** Document missing prerequisites, notify stakeholders, await resolution

**Logging:** Record decision and prerequisites status in execution log

### Root Cause Analysis Framework

When protocol execution encounters blockers or quality gate failures:

1. **Identify Symptom:** What immediate issue prevented progress?
2. **Trace to Root Cause:**
   - Was prerequisite artifact missing or incomplete?
   - Did upstream protocol deliver inadequate inputs?
   - Were instructions ambiguous or insufficient?
   - Did environmental conditions fail?
3. **Document in Protocol Execution Log:**
   ```markdown
   **Blocker:** [Description]
   **Root Cause:** [Analysis]
   **Resolution:** [Action taken]
   **Prevention:** [Process/template update to prevent recurrence]
   ```
4. **Implement Fix:** Update protocol, re-engage stakeholders, adjust execution
5. **Validate Fix:** Re-run quality gates, confirm resolution

### Learning Mechanisms

#### Feedback Loops
**Purpose:** Establish continuous feedback collection to inform protocol improvements.

**Feedback Loop 1: Execution Outcomes**
- **Collection:** Capture outcome data after each protocol execution
- **Analysis:** Identify patterns in successful vs. failed executions
- **Action:** Update protocol templates based on patterns
- **Closure:** Validate improvements in next executions

**Feedback Loop 2: Quality Gate Performance**
- **Collection:** Track gate pass/fail patterns in historical logs
- **Analysis:** Identify consistently failing gates or criteria
- **Action:** Adjust gate thresholds or improve upstream deliverables
- **Closure:** Monitor adjusted gates for improved pass rates

**Feedback Loop 3: Downstream Protocol Feedback**
- **Collection:** Capture issues reported by Protocol 04 and 06
- **Analysis:** Identify gaps in brief content or structure
- **Action:** Enhance brief template or validation criteria
- **Closure:** Verify downstream satisfaction improves

**Feedback Loop 4: Stakeholder Satisfaction**
- **Collection:** Gather feedback from client and internal teams
- **Analysis:** Identify pain points in approval process
- **Action:** Streamline approval workflow or communication
- **Closure:** Measure reduced approval collection time

- **Action:** Adapt approval collection method
- **Example:** Async client → Email approval; Sync client → Call approval
- **Benefit:** Faster approval turnaround

**Adaptation 4: Automation Selection**
- **Trigger:** Available tooling and environment
- **Action:** Choose optimal validation approach
- **Example:** CI/CD available → Automated gates; Manual only → Checklists
- **Benefit:** Maximum efficiency with available resources

### Meta-Cognition

- **Velocity monitoring:** Flag execution delays beyond expected duration
- **Quality monitoring:** Track gate pass rates and artifact completeness
- **Anomaly detection:** Alert on unexpected patterns or deviations

#### Self-Correction Protocols
**Purpose:** Enable autonomous detection and correction of execution issues.

- **Halt condition detection:** Recognize blockers and escalate appropriately
- **Quality gate failure handling:** Generate corrective action plans
- **Anomaly response:** Diagnose and propose fixes for unexpected conditions
- **Recovery procedures:** Maintain execution state for graceful resume

#### Continuous Improvement Integration
**Purpose:** Systematically capture lessons and evolve protocol effectiveness.

- **Retrospective execution:** Conduct after-action reviews post-completion
- **Template review cadence:** Scheduled protocol enhancement cycles
- **Gate calibration:** Periodic adjustment of pass criteria
- **Tool evaluation:** Assessment of automation effectiveness
