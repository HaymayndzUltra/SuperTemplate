# Format Analysis for Protocol 02 - Client Discovery Initiation

## Section-by-Section Format Choices

### 1. PREREQUISITES
- **Format Applied:** GUIDELINES-FORMATS
- **Reasoning:** Establishes mandatory artifacts, approvals, and system state rules that must be satisfied prior to execution.
- **Content Preserved:** All strict requirement lists for artifacts, approvals, and environment checks.

### 2. AI ROLE AND MISSION
- **Format Applied:** GUIDELINES-FORMATS
- **Reasoning:** Defines operating principles and non-negotiable constraints for the AI orchestrator before workflow begins.
- **Content Preserved:** Mission statement and strict prohibition against advancing without validated discovery answers.

### 3. WORKFLOW
- **Overall Format Applied:** EXECUTION-FORMATS (mixed variants by phase)
- **Reasoning:** Workflow phases require different execution structures based on decision load and substep complexity.

#### PHASE 1: Context Alignment
- **Variant:** EXECUTION-BASIC
- **Why:** Straightforward context review and note capture without branching decisions.
- **Content Preserved:** Proposal review actions, evidence artifacts, validation criteria, and communication cues.

#### PHASE 2: Requirement Deep Dive
- **Variant:** EXECUTION-REASONING
- **Why:** Includes critical prioritization and technical validation decisions that demand explicit premises, alternatives, and risk treatments.
- **Content Preserved:** MoSCoW prioritization reasoning, technical constraint analysis, risk capture guidance, and all evidence targets.

#### PHASE 3: Delivery Framework Alignment
- **Variant:** EXECUTION-BASIC
- **Why:** Aligns timeline, budget, collaboration, and governance via direct confirmation steps without deep branching logic.
- **Content Preserved:** Timeline confirmation steps, communication planning requirements, governance mapping, and halt conditions.

#### PHASE 4: Discovery Confirmation
- **Variant:** EXECUTION-BASIC
- **Why:** Focuses on recap delivery, archival, and confirmation activities that follow a linear checklist pattern.
- **Content Preserved:** Recap generation, archival instructions, communication prompts, and evidence directory references.

### 4. REASONING & COGNITIVE PROCESS
- **Format Applied:** META-FORMATS
- **Reasoning:** Documents reasoning patterns, decision logic, and learning loops required for meta-level protocol governance.
- **Content Preserved:** Primary/secondary reasoning patterns, decision criteria, root-cause framework, feedback loops, and improvement tracking guidance.

### 5. REFLECTION & LEARNING
- **Format Applied:** META-FORMATS
- **Reasoning:** Captures continuous improvement cadence, retrospective prompts, and knowledge management strategy.
- **Content Preserved:** Retrospective agenda, improvement opportunities, metrics, roadmap alignment, and knowledge capture workflows.

### 6. INTEGRATION POINTS
- **Format Applied:** GUIDELINES-FORMATS
- **Reasoning:** Enumerates inbound/outbound dependencies, storage paths, and integration requirements as structured rules.
- **Content Preserved:** All input sources, downstream outputs, and artifact storage mappings.

### 7. QUALITY GATES
- **Format Applied:** EXECUTION-BASIC
- **Reasoning:** Provides checklist-style gate definitions with explicit criteria and evidence for each discovery gate.
- **Content Preserved:** Gate names, pass thresholds, evaluation criteria, and linked artifacts.

### 8. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS
- **Format Applied:** GUIDELINES-FORMATS
- **Reasoning:** Details standardized announcements, validation prompts, and error handling scripts that function as communication rules.
- **Content Preserved:** Status templates, validation prompts, escalation procedures, and conditional responses.

### 9. AUTOMATION HOOKS
- **Format Applied:** EXECUTION-BASIC (with automation emphasis)
- **Reasoning:** Lists deterministic validation scripts, CI/CD integration points, and manual fallbacks that execute in a structured sequence.
- **Content Preserved:** Script catalog, execution contexts, triggering conditions, and fallback guidance.

### 10. HANDOFF CHECKLIST
- **Format Applied:** EXECUTION-BASIC
- **Reasoning:** Delivers sequential checks to confirm completeness before advancing to Protocol 03.
- **Content Preserved:** Pre-handoff validation steps, checklist items, and downstream handoff requirements.

### 11. EVIDENCE SUMMARY
- **Format Applied:** META-FORMATS
- **Reasoning:** Aggregates evidence inventory, traceability, and verification metrics at a meta-analysis level.
- **Content Preserved:** Evidence lists, traceability matrix, archival instructions, metrics, and verification notes.

## Format Decision Summary
- **Execution Sections:** EXECUTION-BASIC and EXECUTION-REASONING applied according to step complexity and decision density.
- **Meta Sections:** META-FORMATS ensure reasoning transparency, reflection, and continuous improvement documentation.
- **Guideline Sections:** GUIDELINES-FORMATS maintain strict prerequisite, role, communication, and integration rules.
- **Automation Sections:** Structured as EXECUTION-BASIC with automation annotations to preserve deterministic runbooks.

All content elements—including reasoning narratives, evidence paths, scripts, gates, and automation hooks—remain unchanged from the original protocol while improving structural clarity.
