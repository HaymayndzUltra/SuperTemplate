-### STEP 1: Context Alignment
+### PHASE 1: Context Alignment
+<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
+<!-- Why: Simple workflow steps for reviewing and capturing context -->
 
 1. **`[MUST]` Review Proposal and Client Response:**
    * **Action:** Synthesize proposal highlights and client feedback to identify priorities, tone, and unresolved questions; log results in `client-context-notes.md`.
-   * **Communication:** 
-     > "[MASTER RAYâ„¢ | PHASE 1 START] - Reviewing accepted proposal and client reply to align objectives."
-   * **Halt condition:** Stop if the client response is missing or ambiguous; request clarification.
    * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-02/client-context-notes.md`
+   * **Validation:** Client context notes contains business objectives, user goals, and success metrics.
+   
+   **Communication:** 
+   > "[MASTER RAYâ„¢ | PHASE 1 START] - Reviewing accepted proposal and client reply to align objectives."
+   
+   **Halt condition:** Stop if the client response is missing or ambiguous; request clarification.
 
 2. **`[GUIDELINE]` Capture Business Background:**
    * **Action:** Draft a one-paragraph summary of the client's business model, target users, and success metrics using public info or provided material.
-   * **Example:**
-     ```markdown
-     **Business Snapshot**
-     - Industry: HealthTech SaaS
-     - Primary Users: Clinic administrators
-     - Success Metric: Reduce patient intake time by 30%
-     ```
+   * **Evidence:** Business snapshot section in `client-context-notes.md`
+   * **Validation:** Summary includes industry, primary users, and at least one success metric.
+   
+   **Example (DO):**
+   ```markdown
+   **Business Snapshot**
+   - Industry: HealthTech SaaS
+   - Primary Users: Clinic administrators
+   - Success Metric: Reduce patient intake time by 30%
+   ```

+<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-REASONING] -->
+<!-- Why: Critical prioritization and validation decisions requiring documented reasoning -->
 
 1. **`[MUST]` Facilitate Feature Prioritization:**
    * **Action:** Guide the client through identifying mandatory MVP features versus optional backlog items; capture in `client-discovery-form.md`.
-   * **Communication:** 
-     > "[PHASE 2] - Confirming core features and optional roadmap items."
