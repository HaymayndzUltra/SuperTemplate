# Validation Report for Protocol 10: Controlled Task Execution

## Content Preservation Validation

| Element Type | Original Count | Reformatted Count | Status |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Evidence references (`**Evidence:**`) | 9 | 49 | ✅ Expanded per EXECUTION format; original artifact paths preserved |
| Script references (`scripts/`) | 13 | 13 | ✅ Preserved |
| Artifact paths (`.artifacts/`) | 27 | 33 | ✅ Preserved (no new repositories introduced) |
| Compliance markers (`[STRICT]`) | 2 | 8 | ✅ Converted mandatory checklist items to `[STRICT]` directives |
| Compliance markers (`[MUST]`) | 11 | 31 | ✅ Converted actionable steps to `[MUST]` markers |
| Compliance markers (`[GUIDELINE]`) | 4 | 9 | ✅ Converted advisory items to `[GUIDELINE]` markers |
| Reasoning blocks (`[REASONING]`) | 0 | 2 | ✅ Added wrappers around original prioritization rationale |
| Quality gates | 4 | 4 | ✅ Preserved |

## Format Application Validation

- EXECUTION-REASONING used for parent task selection; includes premises, alternatives, decision, risk mitigation.
- EXECUTION-BASIC used for execution, quality, automation, and handoff steps with Action/Evidence/Validation structure.
- GUIDELINES-FORMATS used for prerequisites, role definition, integration points, quality gates, communication, evidence summary.
- META-FORMATS used for reflection and reasoning sections.
- Category comments with "Why" rationale precede each section.

## Diff Review Summary

- Structural updates include numbering normalization, `[MUST]/[GUIDELINE]` markers, and explicit evidence entries for each subtask.
- All script commands, artifact references, gate criteria, and communication templates preserved verbatim.
- Additional evidence rows capture existing requirements in formatted form; no new artifacts introduced.

## Conclusion

✅ **Result:** Reformatted protocol preserves complete content while aligning with category-based formatting standards for controlled task execution.
