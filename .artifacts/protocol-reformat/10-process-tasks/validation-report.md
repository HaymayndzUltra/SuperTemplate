- ✅ Format category comments added for each section
- ✅ Enhanced marker usage ([STRICT], [MUST], [GUIDELINE])
- ✅ Improved visual separation between sections
- ✅ Better alignment of validation criteria with actions
- ✅ Added comprehensive [REASONING] blocks for task execution decisions
- ✅ Detailed substeps for execution loop (1.1-1.3, 2.1-2.3, 3.1-3.3, 4.1-4.2)

### Automation & Integration:
- ✅ All script paths unchanged: `scripts/validate_prerequisites_3.py`, etc.
- ✅ All artifact paths preserved: `.artifacts/protocol-21/`
- ✅ CI/CD YAML configuration intact
- ✅ Manual fallback procedures preserved
