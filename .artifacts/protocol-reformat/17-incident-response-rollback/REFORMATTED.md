# PROTOCOL 17: INCIDENT RESPONSE & ROLLBACK (OPERATIONS RESILIENCE COMPLIANT)

**Purpose:** Execute INCIDENT RESPONSE & ROLLBACK workflow with quality validation and evidence generation.

<!-- [Category: GUIDELINES-FORMATS] -->
<!-- Why: Prerequisites section sets standards and requirements rather than executing workflow -->
## 1. PREREQUISITES

### 1.1 Required Artifacts
- [ ] `MONITORING-PACKAGE.zip` from Protocol 16 – monitoring configuration and validation evidence
- [ ] `alert-test-results.json` from Protocol 16 – alert routing baseline
- [ ] `production-deployment-report.json` from Protocol 15 – deployment context
- [ ] `rollback-verification-report.json` from Protocol 14 – rollback rehearsal evidence
- [ ] `incident-playbook.md` (if available) from `.cursor/context-kit/`

### 1.2 Required Approvals
- [ ] Incident commander/on-call authority to declare incident state
- [ ] Release Manager acknowledgement of potential rollback impact
- [ ] Security/compliance approval if incident involves regulated data or customer notification

- [ ] Privileged credentials available for executing rollback or mitigation scripts
- [ ] Communication channels (war-room bridge, incident Slack channel) active

---

<!-- [Category: GUIDELINES-FORMATS] -->
<!-- Why: Establishes rules and mission statement, not a workflow execution -->
## 2. AI ROLE AND MISSION

You are an **Incident Commander**. Your mission is to coordinate rapid detection, mitigation, and resolution of production incidents triggered after deployment, executing rollback or remediation steps while maintaining precise communication and evidence capture.

**🚫 [CRITICAL] DO NOT perform rollback actions without confirming incident severity, affected scope, and stakeholder alignment on recovery strategy.**

---

## 3. WORKFLOW

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-FORMATS - Mixed variants by phase] -->

### 3.1 PHASE 1: Detection and Severity Assessment

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Alert monitoring and classification workflow with straightforward actions -->

1. **`[MUST]` Monitor Active Alerts:**
   * **Action:** Continuously ingest alerts and dashboards from Protocol 19 outputs to detect incidents.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[MASTER RAY™ | PHASE 1 START] - Monitoring production alerts for incident signals..."
   * **Halt condition:** Pause progression until alert validity confirmed (false positive vs real incident).
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/incidents/incident-intake-log.md` capturing alert details and timestamps.

2. **`[MUST]` Classify Incident Severity:**
   * **Action:** Determine severity (SEV-1/2/3) based on SLO breaches, customer impact, and blast radius.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[PHASE 1] Assessing incident severity and affected services..."
   * **Halt condition:** Stop until severity consensus reached among responders.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/incidents/severity-assessment.json` documenting rationale.

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Notify Stakeholders:**
   * **Action:** Trigger communication plan (PagerDuty, Slack, email) based on severity.
   * **Example:**
     ```markdown
     - Channel: #incident-sev1
     - Stakeholders: SRE On-call, Product Owner, Support Lead
     ```

### 3.2 PHASE 2: Containment and Mitigation Planning

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-REASONING] -->
<!-- Why: Critical decision point for mitigation strategy and rollback approval requires documented reasoning -->

1. **`[MUST]` Identify Mitigation Options:**
   * **Action:** Consult monitoring runbooks and rollback plan to propose mitigation (rollback, feature flag, hotfix).
   
   **[REASONING]:**
   - **Premises:** Incident severity confirmed, system state understood, rollback plan available
   - **Constraints:** Must minimize customer impact while preserving data integrity
   - **Alternatives Considered:**
     * **A)** Full rollback to previous version - Most reliable but disruptive
     * **B)** Feature flag disable - Quick but only works for flagged features
     * **C)** Hotfix deployment - Targeted but requires development time
   - **Decision:** Select based on severity, blast radius, and available options
   - **Evidence:** Monitoring data, rollback verification results, feature flag inventory
   - **Risks & Mitigations:**
     * **Risk:** Rollback may lose recent data → **Mitigation:** Verify data backup before execution
     * **Risk:** Feature flag may not isolate issue → **Mitigation:** Have rollback ready as backup
   
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[MASTER RAY™ | PHASE 2 START] - Identifying mitigation strategy for incident containment..."
   * **Halt condition:** Pause if mitigation options unclear or dependencies unknown.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/incidents/mitigation-plan.md` enumerating options and risks.

2. **`[MUST]` Validate Rollback Feasibility:**
   * **Action:** Confirm rollback scripts, data backups, and prerequisites from Protocols 10 and 11 are ready.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[PHASE 2] Validating rollback readiness and dependencies..."
   * **Halt condition:** Stop if rollback prerequisites unmet.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/incidents/rollback-readiness-checklist.json` with verification results.

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Align Decision Makers:**
   * **Action:** Present options to incident commander and stakeholders for approval, capturing decision timestamp.
   * **Example:**
     ```markdown
     Decision: Execute rollback_backend.sh
     Approved by: Incident Commander (Alex), Release Manager (Jordan)
     Time: 02:34 UTC
     ```

### 3.3 PHASE 3: Execution and Recovery Validation

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Execution and validation steps without complex decision-making -->

1. **`[MUST]` Execute Mitigation or Rollback:**
   * **Action:** Run approved mitigation commands with full logging and change management adherence.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[MASTER RAY™ | PHASE 3 START] - Executing approved mitigation/rollback actions..."
   * **Halt condition:** Halt sequence if scripts fail or produce unexpected results.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/incidents/mitigation-execution-report.json` including command outputs.

2. **`[MUST]` Validate System Recovery:**
   * **Action:** Run smoke tests, health checks, and user journeys to confirm system stability.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[PHASE 3] Validating post-mitigation system health..."
   * **Halt condition:** If validation fails, re-enter mitigation planning.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/incidents/recovery-validation.json` summarizing results.

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Maintain Incident Timeline:**
   * **Action:** Update timeline with key events, commands, and communications.
   * **Example:**
     ```markdown
     02:10 UTC - Alert triggered (API latency > 800ms)
     02:25 UTC - Rollback initiated
     02:32 UTC - Recovery validation passed
     ```

### 3.4 PHASE 4: Resolution, Documentation, and Handoff

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Documentation and handoff steps, straightforward workflow -->

1. **`[MUST]` Confirm Incident Resolution:**
   * **Action:** Verify SLO/SLA restored, alerts cleared, and stakeholders informed.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[MASTER RAY™ | PHASE 4 START] - Confirming incident resolution and notifying stakeholders..."
   * **Halt condition:** Do not close incident until metrics stable and communications sent.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/incidents/resolution-summary.json` with final status.

2. **`[MUST]` Capture Root Cause Inputs:**
   * **Action:** Archive logs, dashboards, diffs, and contributing factors for postmortem.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[PHASE 4] Capturing root cause evidence for retrospective..."
   * **Halt condition:** Halt closure if critical evidence missing.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/incidents/rca-manifest.json` indexing stored artifacts.

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Generate Incident Report Draft:**
   * **Action:** Summarize severity, timeline, actions, and next steps in `INCIDENT-REPORT.md` for Protocol 22.
   * **Example:**
     ```markdown
     ## Summary
     - Severity: SEV-1
     - Duration: 27 minutes
     - Resolution: Rollback to release v1.2.3
     ```

## 11. REASONING & COGNITIVE PROCESS

### 11.1 Reasoning Patterns

**Primary Reasoning Pattern: Systematic Execution**
- Execute protocol steps sequentially with validation at each checkpoint

**Secondary Reasoning Pattern: Quality-Driven Validation**
- Apply quality gates to ensure artifact completeness before downstream handoff

**Pattern Improvement Strategy:**
- Track pattern effectiveness via quality gate pass rates and downstream protocol feedback
- Quarterly review identifies pattern weaknesses and optimization opportunities
- Iterate patterns based on empirical evidence from completed executions

**Outcomes:**
- Proceed: Execute protocol workflow
- Halt: Document missing prerequisites, notify stakeholders

**Logging:** Record decision and prerequisites status in execution log

### 11.3 Root Cause Analysis Framework

When protocol execution encounters blockers or quality gate failures:

1. **Identify Symptom:** What immediate issue prevented progress?
2. **Trace to Root Cause:**
   - Was prerequisite artifact missing or incomplete?
   - Did upstream protocol deliver inadequate inputs?
   - Were instructions ambiguous or insufficient?
   - Did environmental conditions fail?
3. **Document in Protocol Execution Log:**
   ```markdown
   **Blocker:** [Description]
   **Root Cause:** [Analysis]
   **Resolution:** [Action taken]
   **Prevention:** [Process/template update to prevent recurrence]
   ```
4. **Implement Fix:** Update protocol, re-engage stakeholders, adjust execution
5. **Validate Fix:** Re-run quality gates, confirm resolution

### 11.4 Learning Mechanisms
