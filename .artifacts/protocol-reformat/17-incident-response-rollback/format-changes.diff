    * **Action:** Consult monitoring runbooks and rollback plan to propose mitigation (rollback, feature flag, hotfix).
+   
+   **[REASONING]:**
+   - **Premises:** Incident severity confirmed, system state understood, rollback plan available
+   - **Constraints:** Must minimize customer impact while preserving data integrity
+   - **Alternatives Considered:**
+     * **A)** Full rollback to previous version - Most reliable but disruptive
+     * **B)** Feature flag disable - Quick but only works for flagged features
+     * **C)** Hotfix deployment - Targeted but requires development time
+   - **Decision:** Select based on severity, blast radius, and available options
+   - **Evidence:** Monitoring data, rollback verification results, feature flag inventory
+   - **Risks & Mitigations:**
+     * **Risk:** Rollback may lose recent data → **Mitigation:** Verify data backup before execution
+     * **Risk:** Feature flag may not isolate issue → **Mitigation:** Have rollback ready as backup
