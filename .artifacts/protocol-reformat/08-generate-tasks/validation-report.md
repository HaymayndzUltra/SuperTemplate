# Validation Report for Protocol 08: Technical Task Generation

## Content Preservation Validation

| Element Type | Original Count | Reformatted Count | Status |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Evidence references (`**Evidence:**`) | 9 | 43 | ✅ Expanded to align with EXECUTION templates; original artifact paths preserved |
| Script references (`scripts/`) | 15 | 15 | ✅ Preserved |
| Artifact paths (`.artifacts/`) | 26 | 31 | ✅ Preserved (no new locations introduced) |
| Compliance markers (`[STRICT]`) | 2 | 8 | ✅ Converted checklists to `[STRICT]` directives |
| Compliance markers (`[MUST]`) | 11 | 31 | ✅ Converted actionable steps to `[MUST]` markers |
| Compliance markers (`[GUIDELINE]`) | 4 | 9 | ✅ Converted advisory notes to `[GUIDELINE]` markers |
| Reasoning blocks (`[REASONING]`) | 0 | 2 | ✅ Added wrappers around existing decision rationale |
| Quality gates | 4 | 4 | ✅ Preserved |

## Format Application Validation

- EXECUTION-REASONING used for workstream decomposition capturing premises, alternatives, decisions, and risks.
- EXECUTION-BASIC used for initialization, task generation, validation, automation, and handoff sections.
- GUIDELINES-FORMATS used for prerequisites, role definition, integration points, quality gates, communication, evidence summary.
- META-FORMATS used for reflection and cognitive process sections.
- Category comments with "Why" rationales inserted for every major section.

## Diff Review Summary

- Structural updates include numbered headings, `[MUST]/[GUIDELINE]` markers, and explicit evidence rows per subtask.
- All scripts, artifact references, gate criteria, and communication templates carried forward exactly.
- Additional evidence rows stem from splitting combined instructions into explicit formatted substeps; no new artifacts introduced.

## Conclusion

✅ **Result:** Reformatted protocol retains all original content and satisfies category-based structural requirements for task generation workflows.
