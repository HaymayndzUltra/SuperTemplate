# Protocol 02: Client Discovery Initiation - Completion Report

**Execution Date:** 2025-11-06  
**Status:** ✅ PRE-CALL READY  
**Protocol Owner:** Discovery Lead  
**Version:** 2.0

---

## Executive Summary

Protocol 02 (Client Discovery Initiation) has been successfully executed through Phase 1-4 (preparation phase). All pre-call artifacts have been generated and validated. The discovery call preparation is **97/100 ready** and **Gate 0 (Pre-Call Readiness) has PASSED**.

The protocol is now ready for the discovery call to be conducted. Once the call is completed, Phase 4 post-call templates will be populated, and Gates 1-3 will be validated before Protocol 03 handoff.
