# Protocol 02 Manual Validation Log

## 2025-10-19
- Prerequisite check failed: `.artifacts/protocol-02/client-reply.md` is missing. Cannot confirm client acceptance or response to proceed with discovery.
- Prerequisite check failed: Business development lead approval not found in repository artifacts. Need documented approval before initiating structured discovery.
- Prerequisite check failed: `.templates/discovery/` directory absent, so discovery templates are unavailable for session preparation.
- Prerequisite check observation: No evidence of scheduled communication channel or confirmation transcript located. Require scheduling details before Phase 1 start.

Action Required: Obtain the missing artifacts/approvals and upload to the specified locations. Resume Protocol 02 only after prerequisites are satisfied.
