## Response

Hey, thanks for the quick turnaround on the proposal!

**Yes, let's move forward.** Timeline and pricing look good.

**Answers to your questions:**

1. **Start date:** Monday works perfectly - let's do it
2. **Stripe account:** Test account is already set up, I'll share credentials on Monday
3. **DataForSEO rate limit:** We're on the Growth plan - 5,000 requests/month, currently using ~2,000/month
4. **Performance baseline:** <500ms dashboard load is exactly what we need - that's the target

**Additional context you'll need:**

- We have 8 test GBP accounts set up for development
- Current OAuth implementation uses the following scopes: `BUSINESS_PROFILE_BASIC`, `BUSINESS_PROFILE_LOCATIONS`, `BUSINESS_PROFILE_REVIEWS` 
- Supabase project is already provisioned with RLS policies partially implemented
- Next.js app running on Vercel (currently on hobby plan, will upgrade to Pro before production)
- We have a staging environment available for testing before production deployment

**Communication preference:** Let's start with async via Slack, but I'm available for a quick call if you hit any blockers. I'm usually online 10am-6pm EST.

**Main concerns/priorities:**

1. **Data isolation is critical** - we've had issues in the past with keyword suggestions bleeding across accounts
2. **Stripe webhook reliability** - we need idempotency to handle retries properly
3. **Dashboard performance** - current load time is ~2.3 seconds, which is hurting conversion

Looking forward to getting this wrapped up!

**Approval:** âœ… Proposal accepted  
**Next step:** Monday kickoff - I'll send Slack invite + credentials over the weekend
