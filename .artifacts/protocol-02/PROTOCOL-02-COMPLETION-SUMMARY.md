## Outstanding Items

### Blocking Gate 4 Approval:
- ⏳ Client approval of discovery recap (deadline: Friday, Nov 1, 2025)

### For Monday Kickoff (Non-Blocking):
Client will provide:
1. Slack invite
2. Stripe test credentials
3. Supabase staging access confirmation
4. Answers to 6 open questions:
   - GBP API quotas observed
   - Performance profiling data (current 2.3s bottlenecks)
   - RLS policy completion status
   - Staging configuration details
   - Error monitoring setup (Sentry?)
   - Deployment process (manual vs. CI/CD)

### For M1 Execution (Week 1):
1. Validate OAuth write permissions (Day 1-2)
2. Complete Supabase RLS policies (before production)
3. Monitor DataForSEO rate limits (track daily usage)
4. Confirm Vercel Pro upgrade timeline (before M3)

---

## Lessons Learned & Observations

### What Went Well:
1. **Client Communication:** Clear, direct response with technical details (OAuth scopes, API plans, infrastructure)
2. **Scope Clarity:** Client provided specific priorities (data isolation, webhook reliability, performance)
3. **Technical Context:** Client shared current state (RLS partial, 2.3s load time, test accounts ready)
4. **Timeline Alignment:** Client confirmed start date and availability immediately

### Risk Flags Identified Early:
1. **Data Isolation History:** Client explicitly mentioned past keyword bleeding issues → Critical priority
2. **Performance Gap:** 78% improvement needed (2.3s → <500ms) → Aggressive but documented
3. **Partial RLS:** Incomplete RLS policies → Security risk, must complete before production
4. **Vercel Upgrade:** Hobby → Pro required → Timeline dependency

### Discovery Efficiency:
- **Single Client Response:** All needed info provided in one reply (efficient discovery)
- **Technical Maturity:** Client demonstrated strong technical understanding (OAuth scopes, API plans, RLS)
- **Async-First Preference:** Matches Protocol 02 async communication approach

### Recommendations for M1-M3:
1. **Week 1 Priority:** Validate data isolation (client's #1 concern) before proceeding to other features
2. **Performance Strategy:** Request profiling data Monday to avoid premature optimization
3. **Risk Monitoring:** Daily check on critical risks (RLS completion, rate limits, OAuth permissions)
4. **Client Communication:** Maintain daily EOD updates as promised (build trust through transparency)
