# Client Discovery Form â€“ Protocol 02

## Status
Feature prioritization has not been captured. Discovery session cannot proceed without verified client response and approvals.

## Pending Inputs
- Client-confirmed MVP feature list
- Optional backlog items

## Blocking Issues
- Absent `client-reply.md` artifact confirming proposal acceptance.
- No documented meeting or call scheduled with the client.

## Next Steps
- Secure client engagement and approval artifacts, then rerun feature prioritization interviews.
