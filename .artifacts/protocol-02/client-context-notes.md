**Protocol:** 02 - Client Discovery Initiation  
**Project:** Surfa - AI-powered Local SEO SaaS Platform

---

## Business Snapshot

**Industry:** SaaS - Local SEO / Marketing Technology  
**Primary Users:** Local business owners managing Google Business Profile (GBP) listings  
**Business Model:** Subscription-based SaaS with Stripe payment integration  
**Current Stage:** Near production-ready (90% complete, final 10% integration work needed)

**Success Metrics:**
1. **Performance:** Dashboard load time <500ms (currently ~2.3 seconds)
2. **Data Isolation:** Zero cross-account data leakage (reviews/keywords)
3. **Payment Reliability:** 100% webhook idempotency for Stripe retries
4. **Multi-tenant Sync:** Reviews + rankings sync across all 8 GBP test accounts

---

## Business Objectives

### Primary Objective
Complete production-ready deployment of Surfa platform with:
- Fully functional review management across multiple GBP accounts
- Location-aware keyword suggestions with proper data isolation
- Production-grade Stripe payment integration
- Optimized dashboard performance meeting <500ms load target

### User Goals
1. **GBP Account Management:** Manage multiple Google Business Profile locations from single dashboard
2. **Review Center:** Sync reviews across all GBPs and post replies to live profiles
3. **Keyword Intelligence:** Get location + category-specific keyword suggestions via DataForSEO
4. **Subscription Management:** Seamless Stripe checkout with reliable payment state tracking

### Technical Goals
1. **Multi-tenant Architecture:** Enforce strict data isolation using Supabase RLS policies
2. **API Integration Reliability:** Handle GBP OAuth scopes, DataForSEO rate limits, Stripe webhooks
3. **Performance Optimization:** Next.js SSR caching, API deduplication, lazy loading
4. **Production Deployment:** Vercel Pro hosting with staging environment validation

## Client Priorities & Concerns

### Critical Priorities (from client response)

1. **Data Isolation (CRITICAL)**
   - **Context:** "We've had issues in the past with keyword suggestions bleeding across accounts"
   - **Impact:** High - Core multi-tenant requirement, affects trust and compliance
   - **Requirement:** Supabase RLS policies + per-GBP filtering in DataForSEO queries

2. **Stripe Webhook Reliability (CRITICAL)**
   - **Context:** "We need idempotency to handle retries properly"
   - **Impact:** High - Payment state drift can cause billing issues and user confusion
   - **Requirement:** Webhook replay protection, subscription state management

3. **Dashboard Performance (HIGH)**
   - **Context:** "Current load time is ~2.3 seconds, which is hurting conversion"
   - **Impact:** High - Directly affects user activation and retention
   - **Target:** <500ms dashboard load after login

---

## Proposal Highlights

### Deliverables Accepted
1. Reviews sync across all GBPs (not just dev account)
2. Review replies post to live profiles
3. Keywords isolated per GBP with location context
4. Stripe checkout + webhooks tested (test & live mode)
5. Dashboard loads <500ms after login

### Timeline & Budget
- **Duration:** 2-3 weeks
- **Total Cost:** $3,780 (42 hours @ $90/hr)
- **Delivery Model:** Milestone-based with clear checkpoints
- **Milestones:**
  - M1: Reviews + Rankings sync complete - $1,800 (45%)
  - M2: Stripe + Performance baseline - $1,440 (40%)
  - M3: Production validation - $540 (15%)

### Accepted Assumptions
- GBP API allowlist is active
- Rate limits won't throttle during testing
- Main challenges: multi-tenant isolation, timeout handling, webhook idempotency

## Client Technical Context

### Infrastructure (from client reply)
- **Backend:** Supabase (RLS policies partially implemented)
- **Frontend:** Next.js on Vercel (Hobby plan → upgrading to Pro)
- **Payment:** Stripe (test account ready, credentials to be shared Monday)
- **SEO API:** DataForSEO Growth plan (5,000 requests/month, ~2,000 current usage)
- **Testing:** 8 test GBP accounts provisioned for development
- **Environments:** Staging environment available for pre-production testing

### OAuth Implementation
- **Scopes in use:** `BUSINESS_PROFILE_BASIC`, `BUSINESS_PROFILE_LOCATIONS`, `BUSINESS_PROFILE_REVIEWS`
- **Write access validation needed:** Confirm scopes allow review replies for all connected GBPs

### Current State
- Supabase RLS policies: Partially implemented
- Dashboard performance: ~2.3 seconds (needs optimization to <500ms)
- OAuth flow: Functional but needs write scope verification
- Stripe integration: Test environment ready, needs webhook + subscription logic

---

## Communication & Availability

### Client Preferences
- **Primary Channel:** Async via Slack (preferred)
- **Availability:** 10am-6pm EST, Monday-Friday
- **Escalation:** Quick call available for blockers
- **Start Date:** Monday (confirmed)
- **Kickoff Actions:** Client will send Slack invite + Stripe credentials over weekend

### Communication Cadence
- Daily commits with isolated fixes
- Async updates via Slack (no mandatory sync calls unless blocker)
- Milestone-based progress reviews

## Unresolved Questions & Risks

### Questions for Discovery Phase 2
1. **DataForSEO API Context:** Are category + location parameters currently passed in keyword queries?
2. **GBP Rate Limits:** Any observed throttling during prior development?
3. **RLS Policy Gaps:** Which Supabase tables still need RLS implementation?
4. **Performance Bottlenecks:** Current profiling data available for 2.3s dashboard load?
5. **Staging Deployment:** What's the staging environment deployment process?

### Known Risks (from proposal analysis)
1. **Medium Risk:** Timeout handling for slow GBP API responses → Need request queuing or async retry
2. **Medium Risk:** DataForSEO rate limit exhaustion during testing → Monitor usage against 5k/month limit
3. **Low Risk:** Vercel Hobby → Pro upgrade timing → Confirm upgrade before production deployment

---

## Discovery Approach

**Complexity Assessment:** Standard flow with extended technical deep dive
- **Integration Count:** 3 major APIs (GBP, DataForSEO, Stripe)
- **Technical Maturity:** High (client has technical background, clear technical requirements)
- **Communication Style:** Async-first, direct, technical precision preferred
- **Risk Tolerance:** Low (data isolation and payment reliability are critical)

**Recommendation:** Use technical founder persona template with detailed technical discovery form and async-first approach.

## Next Discovery Steps

1. **PHASE 2:** Facilitate feature prioritization (MVP vs. nice-to-have)
2. **PHASE 2:** Validate technical requirements (RLS policies, API rate limits, performance targets)
3. **PHASE 2:** Capture detailed risks and assumptions
4. **PHASE 3:** Confirm milestone timeline and budget guardrails
5. **PHASE 3:** Establish communication plan (Slack channels, escalation procedure)
6. **PHASE 4:** Generate discovery recap for client approval
