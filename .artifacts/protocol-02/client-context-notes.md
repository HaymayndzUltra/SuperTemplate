# Client Context Notes â€“ Protocol 02

## Status
Context alignment could not begin because the required client reply artifact is missing.

## Observations
- `PROPOSAL.md` and `proposal-summary.json` from Protocol 01 are available for review.
- No client acknowledgement or reply was located in `.artifacts/protocol-02/` or related directories.

## Blockers
- Client acceptance of the proposal is unverified.
- Without client feedback, priorities and open questions cannot be synthesized.

## Next Action
- Await receipt of the client reply and approval confirmation before attempting Phase 1 of Protocol 02.
