**Communication:**
```markdown
üíª **Technical Decision - [Date]**

**Decision:** [Description]
**Rationale:** [Why this approach]
**Impact:** [Timeline/budget/risk: none expected]
**Alternatives Considered:** [Brief mention if relevant]

[No approval needed - informing for transparency]
```

---

### Process 2: Feature Scope Change
**Owner:** Client (approves/rejects)  
**Initiator:** Either party can propose  
**SLA:** 2 business days for decision

**Trigger Scenarios:**
- Client requests feature not in original proposal
- Developer identifies missing requirement during discovery
- Performance target adjustment needed

**Process:**
1. **Proposal:** Initiator documents change request (see template below)
2. **Impact Analysis:** Developer estimates effort, timeline, budget impact
3. **Options:** Present options (approve, defer, reject)
4. **Client Decision:** Client chooses within 2 business days
5. **Documentation:** Update `client-discovery-form.md` if scope changes
6. **Timeline Adjustment:** Update `timeline-discussion.md` if applicable

**Template:**
```markdown
üìã **Scope Change Request - [Date]**

**Requested By:** [Client/Developer]

**Description:** [What's being added/changed/removed]

**Rationale:** [Why this change is needed]

**Impact Analysis:**
- Effort: [hours]
- Cost: [$amount]
- Timeline: [+/- X days to milestone]
- Risk: [Low/Medium/High - description]

**Options:**
1. **Approve + Adjust:** Add to current milestone (delay M[X] by Y days, increase budget by $Z)
2. **Defer:** Move to post-launch backlog (no immediate impact)
3. **Reject:** Do not implement (no change)

**Developer Recommendation:** [Option X] because [rationale]

**Client Decision:** [To be confirmed]
```

5. **Client:** Decision:
   - **PASS:** Approve milestone, authorize payment
   - **FAIL:** Document issues, developer fixes, re-submit for validation

**Acceptance Criteria Template:**
```markdown
‚úÖ **Milestone [N] Acceptance - [Date]**

**Deliverables:**
- [Feature 1]: ‚úÖ Pass / ‚ùå Fail - [Comments]
- [Feature 2]: ‚úÖ Pass / ‚ùå Fail - [Comments]

- [ ] Staging validation complete (all tests pass)
- [ ] No P0/P1 bugs outstanding
- [ ] Vercel Pro upgrade confirmed
- [ ] Stripe live mode credentials configured
- [ ] RLS policies validated (zero data leakage)
- [ ] Performance targets met (<500ms dashboard load)

## Conflict Resolution

### Disagreement on Scope
**Scenario:** Developer believes feature is out of scope, client believes it's included

**Resolution:**
1. Reference `client-discovery-form.md` MVP section
2. Review original proposal (`PROPOSAL.md`)
3. If ambiguous: Developer provides effort estimate ‚Üí Client decides (approve vs. defer)
4. Document decision in scope change log

---

### Disagreement on Quality
**Scenario:** Client rejects milestone, developer believes acceptance criteria met

**Resolution:**
1. Review acceptance criteria in `client-discovery-form.md`
2. Test on staging together (async or live call)
3. Identify specific failing criteria (must be objective, measurable)
4. Developer fixes objective failures
5. If criteria are subjective/unclear: Clarify criteria, re-test

---

### Timeline Dispute
**Scenario:** Developer needs more time, client has hard deadline

**Resolution:**
1. Developer documents blocker/reason for delay
2. Propose options:
   - **Option A:** Reduce scope (defer features to backlog)
   - **Option B:** Extend timeline (move deadline)
   - **Option C:** Add resources (increase budget)
3. Client chooses option
4. Update timeline and communicate to all stakeholders
