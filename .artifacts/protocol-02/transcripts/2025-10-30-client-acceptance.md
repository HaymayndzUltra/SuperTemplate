Thanks for the detailed breakdown. Your approach makes sense, especially the focus on multi-tenant isolation—that's exactly the issue we're hitting.

**Accepting your proposal at $5,500-6,750 (54-hour cap at $125/hr).**

A few quick answers to your questions:

**Load time target:** Yes, <500ms would be ideal. Right now dashboard takes 2-3 seconds on initial load, which feels sluggish. If we can get under 500ms consistently, that'd be perfect.

**Scope completeness:** The 4 tasks are comprehensive for this phase. There might be minor edge cases (like review moderation filters or keyword deduplication), but we can handle those as they come up. Let's focus on the core issues first.

**Production-ready definition:** For this phase, functional completeness is the priority. We have basic error logging with Vercel, but we're not expecting full Sentry integration or load testing right now—just stable, working features that don't break when multiple users are active.

**Next steps:**
- I can start Monday (Nov 4) works perfectly for me
- Let's do a quick 30-min kickoff call Monday 10am EST to walk through the codebase architecture
- Repo access: I'll add you to the GitHub org (surfa-ai/surfa-platform) by end of day Friday
- Communication: Daily Slack updates work best for me (I'll invite you to our #dev-integration channel)

**Access details I'll provide:**
- GitHub repo access (main + staging branches)
- Vercel project access (for deployment logs)
- Test GBP accounts (I have 3 test business profiles we can use)
- DataForSEO API sandbox credentials
- Stripe test mode keys (already in .env.example)

**Milestones:**
Your 3-milestone structure works. Let's do:
- Milestone 1 payment: After reviews sync + keywords working (Week 1-2)
- Milestone 2 payment: After Stripe + performance improvements (Week 2-3)

I'm responsive on Slack during business hours (9am-6pm EST) and usually check email within a few hours. If something's blocking you, just ping me directly.

Looking forward to getting this wrapped up!

Marcus
