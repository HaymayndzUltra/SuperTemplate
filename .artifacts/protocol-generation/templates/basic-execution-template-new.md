# BASIC EXECUTION FORMAT TEMPLATE
<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-FORMATS - BASIC variant] -->
<!-- Why: Simple linear workflow with clear phase progression -->

## PHASE 1: PREPARATION
**[STRICT]** Complete all preparation steps before proceeding.

### 1.1 Input Validation
- [ ] Verify all required artifacts are present
- [ ] Validate input data integrity
- [ ] Confirm system state readiness

### 1.2 Resource Setup
- [ ] Allocate required computational resources
- [ ] Initialize working directories
- [ ] Configure environment variables

**Halt-and-await**: Confirm preparation complete before proceeding to Phase 2.

---

## PHASE 2: EXECUTION
**[STRICT]** Execute steps in sequence. Do not skip steps.

### 2.1 Core Processing
1. **Step 1**: [Action description]
   - Input: [What's needed]
   - Output: [What's produced]
   - Validation: [How to verify]

2. **Step 2**: [Action description]
   - Input: [Result from Step 1]
   - Output: [What's produced]
   - Validation: [How to verify]

### 2.2 Quality Assurance
- [ ] Verify output completeness
- [ ] Validate data integrity
- [ ] Check compliance requirements

**Halt-and-await**: Confirm execution complete before proceeding to Phase 3.

---

## PHASE 3: VALIDATION
**[STRICT]** Validate all outputs meet quality criteria.

### 3.1 Output Verification
- [ ] Confirm all required artifacts generated
- [ ] Validate artifact formats and schemas
- [ ] Check quantitative quality metrics

### 3.2 Stakeholder Review
- [ ] Present validation results
- [ ] Collect stakeholder sign-off
- [ ] Document any exceptions or deviations

**Halt-and-await**: Proceed to Phase 4 only after validation approval.

---

## PHASE 4: HANDOFF
**[STRICT]** Prepare and execute clean handoff to next protocol.

### 4.1 Artifact Packaging
- [ ] Consolidate all deliverables
- [ ] Generate handoff manifest
- [ ] Store in designated location

### 4.2 Documentation Update
- [ ] Update protocol status
- [ ] Log key decisions and outcomes
- [ ] Prepare handoff summary for next protocol

**Success Criteria**: All artifacts stored, documentation complete, next protocol can proceed without additional context.
