## System Enhancements Completed

### Validator System Improvements
1. ✅ Updated `validator_utils.py` to accept custom protocol directories
2. ✅ Modified all 10 validator scripts to support `--protocol-dir` argument
3. ✅ Added argparse integration across all validators
4. ✅ Tested full validation pipeline successfully

### Usage Example
```bash
python3 validate_protocol_identity.py \
  --protocol 06 \
  --workspace /home/haymayndz/SuperTemplate \
  --protocol-dir /home/haymayndz/SuperTemplate/.cursor/AI-project-workflow
```

### Batch Audit Script
Created `run_full_audit.sh` for comprehensive audits:
```bash
./run_full_audit.sh <workspace> <protocol_dir> <protocol_ids...>
```

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Protocol 09 - Critical)
1. Complete redesign following Protocol 4 quality audit workflow
2. Implement all 10 validator requirements
3. Re-validate until ≥0.95 score achieved

### High Priority (Protocol 08)
1. Add meta-reflection section
2. Enhance REASONING blocks
3. Complete evidence package
4. Re-validate critical validators

### Medium Priority (Protocols 06-07)
