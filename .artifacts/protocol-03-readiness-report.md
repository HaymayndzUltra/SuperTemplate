## Integration Validation

### Protocol 01 → Protocol 02 Handoff
- ✅ PROPOSAL.md referenced in discovery
- ✅ proposal-summary.json used for context
- ✅ Client acceptance documented

### Protocol 02 → Protocol 03 Handoff
- ✅ All discovery artifacts complete
- ✅ Client approval recorded
- ✅ No blocking issues
- ✅ Ready for brief assembly

   - Audit required artifacts ✅ (already validated)
   - Resolve inconsistencies (none found)
   - Capture context summary

2. **STEP 2: Brief Assembly**
   - Compile core sections
   - Embed traceability links
   - Draft risk register

3. **STEP 3: Validation and Approval**
   - Run structural validation
   - Capture approval evidence
