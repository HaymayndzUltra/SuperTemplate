# MASTER RAY™ Meta-Upgrade Validation and Integration (MVI-01)

This report documents discovery, alignment, decisions, and the integration plan for UPG01–UPG10 across protocols 01–23. No protocol files were edited; all outputs are analysis-only artifacts under `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/`.

## Hard Gates Summary
- Master rules present: 1-master-rule-context-discovery.mdc, 2-master-rule-ai-collaboration-guidelines.mdc – VERIFIED
- No new circular dependencies – ASSUMED (graph designed acyclic; POP observer mode)
- Quality gates unchanged or stricter – VERIFIED (no weakening introduced)
- Evidence required for decisions – ENFORCED (intent/analysis/decision artifacts)

## Artifacts
- Protocol catalog: `catalog/protocol_catalog.json`
- Upgrade→Protocol graph: `cross/upgrade_protocol_graph.json`
- Conflicts & remediation: `cross/conflicts_matrix.md`, `cross/remediation_plan.json`
- POP activation criteria: `pop/pop-activation-check.json`
- Integration plan (S0–S9): `integration/integration_plan.json`
- Per-upgrade intents: `UPGxx/intent.json`
- Acceptance matrix: `final/acceptance_matrix.csv`

## Open Items
- Per-upgrade `analysis.json`, `alignment.md`, and `decision.json` pending simulation runs and evidence extraction.
- Simulation (dry-run) outputs to generate: `causal_replay.md`, `governance_diffs.json`.

## Next Steps
1. Generate per-upgrade analysis and decisions (no edits):
   - Path: `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/UPGxx/{analysis.json, alignment.md, decision.json}`
2. Produce simulation artifacts:
   - `cross/causal_replay.md`, `cross/governance_diffs.json`
3. Populate acceptance matrix scores and decisions; publish `final/next_actions.md` for Adapt/Reject cases.
