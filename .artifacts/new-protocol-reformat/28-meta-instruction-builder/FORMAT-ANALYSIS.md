# Format Analysis — 28-meta-instruction-builder

## Category Selections
- **Document Header:** META-FORMATS — Selected to frame the multi-stage meta-instruction system and align with protocol taxonomy.
- **Stage 1 — Role & Intent Explainer:** EXECUTION-REASONING — Chosen because the section captures persona and objectives through guided reasoning loops.
- **Stage 2 — Reasoning Synthesizer (RS):** EXECUTION-REASONING — Maintains analytical evaluation of reasoning strategies with evidence scorecards.
- **Stage 3 — Logic Planner (LP):** EXECUTION-SUBSTEPS — Uses detailed decision mapping, conditional sequencing, and fallback substeps.
- **Stage 4 — Format Designer/Mapper (FD):** EXECUTION-SUBSTEPS — Converts logic into concrete format components via structured substeps and checklists.
- **Stage 5 — Concordance & Alignment Validator (CAV):** EXECUTION-REASONING — Focuses on assessment, integration decisions, and optimization rationale.
- **Validation Summary:** META-FORMATS — Retains meta-level confirmation context for the complete instruction set.

## Structural Adjustments
- Introduced step numbering (`STEP X.Y`) within each stage to clarify execution order.
- Added HTML annotations documenting category selections and justification per command requirements.
- Grouped original templates and logs under “Output Package” subsections to preserve deliverable context while aligning with format system.
- Consolidated transfer and verification instructions into stage-specific step entries without altering instructional content.

## Preservation Checks
- Verified all instruction IDs (1–33) remain with original text for Input/Process/Output/Validation fields.
- Confirmed all templates, tables, and checklists are present in their respective stages.
- Ensured new structure is purely organizational with no content deletions.
