- Type: Master governance rule (BIOS-level)
- Metadata: `alwaysApply: true` | SCOPE: global
- Tags: [global,workflow,context,rules,documentation,discovery]
- Triggers: rule,context,readme,documentation,understand,project,setup,start,discovery
- Directives: 35 [STRICT], multiple [GUIDELINE]
- Sections: 7 major (Persona, Principle, Grammar, Discovery Process, Tagging, Communication, Re-evaluation)
- Complexity: 9/10 - Highly structured multi-phase discovery protocol

**Layer 2: Logic**
- Reasoning Model: Discovery → Inventory → Evaluate → Select → Report → Apply
- Decision Points: 
  * Rule relevance evaluation (Priority 1-5 system)
  * Scope matching vs. keyword matching
  * Fallback for malformed metadata
  * Context re-evaluation triggers
- Cognitive Dependencies: Understanding of YAML frontmatter, file system navigation, rule hierarchy
- Mental Model: System BIOS that loads kernel rules before any operation
- Why→How Chain: Quality context → Relevant rules → Better decisions → Safer execution

**Layer 3: Integration**
- Workflow Phase: Phase 0 (Initialization - runs before all other protocols)
- Rule Dependencies:
  * Must load: Self (context discovery)
  * Must verify: 2-master-rule-ai-collaboration-guidelines.mdc (CRITICAL CHECK)
  * Loads after: Nothing (runs first)
  * Loads before: Everything else
- Protocol Triggers: Activates on every new request or context shift
- Script Bindings: None (pure cognitive protocol)
- Quality Gates: Rule announcement validation, coverage verification
- Evidence Flow:
  * Input: User request, file system state
  * Output: Loaded rules announcement, context snapshot

**Layer 4: Execution**
- Trigger Conditions: 
  * Every new user request
  * Domain change
  * Location change  
  * Explicit pivot
  * TodoWrite scope transition
- Activation Sequence:
  1. Internal cognitive lock (mandatory monologue)
  2. Exhaustive rule inventory (3 phases)
  3. Operational context gathering
  4. Relevance evaluation
  5. Rule announcement (BLOCKING)
  6. Collaboration protocol activation checkpoint
- Checkpoints: 
  * Step 1: Rule directory verification
  * Step 2: Completeness ≥95%

  * Step 4: MANDATORY announcement before ANY other action
  * Step 5: Rule 2 compliance validation
- Human Gates: None (automated cognitive protocol)
- Automation Hooks: None
- Fallback: If Rule 2 missing → CRITICAL FAILURE, halt all processing

**Layer 5: Impact**
- Scope of Influence: ALL protocols, ALL rules, ALL tasks (foundational)
- Ripple: Changes to discovery logic affect entire system initialization
- Conflicts: None detected (BIOS-level, supreme authority)
- Performance: High cognitive load on first execution, cacheable after
- Security: Prevents execution without proper context = safety protocol
- Technical Debt: Sophisticated but essential complexity

**Layer 6: Quality**

- Evolution Role: Foundation for all future rule additions
- Extensibility: Tag system allows infinite rule expansion
- Migration Path: Graceful - new rules auto-discovered via metadata
- Historical Debt: Legacy `.ai-governor/` mentioned but not blocking
