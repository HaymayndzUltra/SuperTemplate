## Conflicts Detected

**Result: ZERO CONFLICTS DETECTED**

### Analysis Method
- Searched for [STRICT] directive conflicts across 14 rule files (173 instances)
- Searched for [MUST] directive conflicts across 28 protocol files (354 instances)
- Reviewed integration points across 28 protocols
- Analyzed rule dependency chains

### Conflict Prevention Mechanisms
1. **Master Rule 2 (Supreme Authority)**: Lines 7-8 - "This document is the supreme operational protocol governing collaboration. Its directives override any other rule in case of conflict"
2. **Master Rule 1 (Priority System)**: Lines 78-95 - Clear rule loading priority (1-5) prevents overlap
3. **Protocol Integration Map**: Documented handoff points prevent execution conflicts

### Potential Future Conflicts (None Currently Active)
- None identified
- Strong governance framework prevents emergence
