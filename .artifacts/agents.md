# AI Agent Task Management System

## 🤖 Agent Instructions & Workflow Protocol

**Created:** 2025-10-28  
**Purpose:** Systematic task tracking and execution for AI-driven artifact analysis and management

---

## 📋 Core Operating Instructions

### Phase 1: Self-Initialization (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
Before ANY analysis or task execution, the AI agent MUST:

1. **Read this file completely** to understand current state
2. **Update the "Current Session" section** below with:
   - Session timestamp
   - AI model identification
   - Planned work scope
3. **Review "Completed Tasks"** to avoid duplication
4. **Review "Next Tasks"** to understand priorities
5. **Commit** to updating this file after EACH task completion

### Phase 2: Artifact Analysis Protocol
When analyzing `/home/haymayndz/AI-DRIVEN-TEMPLATE-TESTING/.artifacts`:

1. **Scan directory structure** systematically
2. **Identify patterns** (UPG folders, protocol artifacts, validation data)
3. **Catalog findings** in the "Analysis Results" section
4. **Prioritize work** based on completeness and dependencies
5. **Break down** into atomic, manageable tasks

### Phase 3: Task Execution Protocol
For EACH task:

1. **Document START** in "In Progress" section
2. **Execute** with full context awareness
3. **Validate** results against quality gates
4. **Document COMPLETION** with evidence
5. **Move** from "In Progress" to "Completed Tasks"
6. **Update** "Next Tasks" based on discoveries

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Task Template:
```
- [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] [Task ID] - Task Description
  - Artifacts: [List of files created/modified]
  - Evidence: [Validation results, quality gate status]
  - Next Actions Triggered: [Related tasks added to queue]
```

### Completed:
<!-- AI will populate this section -->

_No tasks completed yet. This is the initial setup._

## 🔄 In Progress

### Current Task:
<!-- AI updates this section when starting a task -->

_No active tasks._

## 🎯 Analysis Objectives (What AI Should Achieve)

### Primary Objectives:
<!-- These are the goals - AI creates its own plan to achieve them -->

1. **Understand Artifacts Directory Structure**
   - Complete inventory of all files and folders
   - Document relationships and dependencies
   - Identify organizational patterns

2. **Assess Meta-Upgrades Status**
   - Analyze UPG folders (UPG01-UPG10+)
   - Check completion status of each UPG
   - Identify gaps and missing components

3. **Map Protocol Ecosystem**
   - Catalog all protocol artifacts
   - Document dependencies and integration points
   - Assess validation coverage

4. **Evaluate Automation Infrastructure**
   - Inventory scripts and automation tools
   - Map integration with protocols
   - Assess maturity and coverage

### AI Plan Mode Instructions:
<!-- Let Codex create its own task breakdown -->

**When you start:**
1. Read these objectives
2. Analyze the `.artifacts/` directory
3. **Create your own plan** (using Plan Mode)
4. User will review and approve your plan
5. Execute each task in your plan
6. Update this file after each task completion

```

### Key Findings:
<!-- AI populates this as analysis progresses -->

- **Governance System:** Present (governance-index.json)
- **Meta-Upgrades:** 10 UPG folders detected
- **Protocols:** Multiple protocol artifacts found
- **Validation:** Dedicated validation directory exists

### Gaps Identified:
<!-- AI documents gaps found during analysis -->

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Each task is considered complete when:

1. ✅ **Execution Complete:** All defined steps executed
2. ✅ **Evidence Documented:** Results captured in artifacts
3. ✅ **Quality Validated:** Meets defined quality gates
4. ✅ **This File Updated:** Task moved to "Completed" section
5. ✅ **Next Tasks Updated:** Dependencies/follow-ups added to queue

---

## 🔧 Agent Operation Guidelines

### DO:
- ✅ Read this file FIRST before any action
- ✅ Update this file AFTER every task
- ✅ Document all findings comprehensively
- ✅ Break large tasks into smaller atomic units
- ✅ Validate work against quality gates
- ✅ Maintain clear audit trail

### DON'T:
- ❌ Skip updating this file
- ❌ Work without consulting "Next Tasks"
- ❌ Leave tasks in "In Progress" indefinitely
- ❌ Create duplicate work (check "Completed" first)
- ❌ Make assumptions - document uncertainties
- ❌ Proceed without validating prerequisites

## 📖 Quick Reference

### Task Status Lifecycle:
```
Next Tasks → In Progress → Completed Tasks
     ↑            ↓
     └────────────┘
   (new tasks discovered)
```

### File Update Frequency:
- **Before starting work:** Read entire file
- **When starting task:** Update "In Progress"
- **When completing task:** Move to "Completed", update "Next Tasks"
- **When discovering new work:** Add to "Next Tasks"

### Evidence Standards:
- All work must produce tangible artifacts
- Validation results must be documented
- Quality gate status must be explicit
- File paths must be absolute and verified
