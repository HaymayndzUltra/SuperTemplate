2. **Update task status** before and after execution
3. **Document decisions** and outcomes
4. **Maintain continuity** across sessions

## 🔄 Agent Self-Management Rules

### Before Starting ANY Task
1. ✅ Read this `agents.md` file completely
2. ✅ Check "Upcoming Tasks" section for context
3. ✅ Update "Current Task" section with task details
4. ✅ Verify no blockers exist
5. ✅ Plan subtasks in manageable chunks

### During Task Execution
1. ✅ Update subtask checkboxes as completed
2. ✅ Document decisions in "Decisions Made"
3. ✅ Log blockers immediately when encountered
4. ✅ Break large tasks into smaller ones if needed

### After Task Completion
1. ✅ Move completed task to "Completed Tasks" section
2. ✅ Add completion timestamp
3. ✅ Document key outcomes/artifacts created
4. ✅ Update "Analysis Context" with new insights
5. ✅ Identify next priority task from backlog

### Quality Gates
Every task MUST pass:
- [ ] Structural compliance check
- [ ] Content accuracy validation
- [ ] Evidence documentation complete
- [ ] Integration points verified
