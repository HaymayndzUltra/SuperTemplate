# AI Agent Task Management System

## 🤖 Agent Instructions & Workflow Protocol

**Created:** 2025-10-28  
**Purpose:** Systematic task tracking and execution for AI-driven artifact analysis and management

---

## 📋 Core Operating Instructions

### Phase 1: Self-Initialization (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
Before ANY analysis or task execution, the AI agent MUST:

1. **Read this file completely** to understand current state
2. **Update the "Current Session" section** below with:
   - Session timestamp
   - AI model identification
   - Planned work scope
3. **Review "Completed Tasks"** to avoid duplication
4. **Review "Next Tasks"** to understand priorities
5. **Commit** to updating this file after EACH task completion

### Phase 2: Artifact Analysis Protocol
When analyzing `/home/haymayndz/AI-DRIVEN-TEMPLATE-TESTING/.artifacts`:

1. **Scan directory structure** systematically
2. **Identify patterns** (UPG folders, protocol artifacts, validation data)
3. **Catalog findings** in the "Analysis Results" section
4. **Prioritize work** based on completeness and dependencies
5. **Break down** into atomic, manageable tasks

### Phase 3: Task Execution Protocol
For EACH task:

1. **Document START** in "In Progress" section
2. **Execute** with full context awareness
3. **Validate** results against quality gates
4. **Document COMPLETION** with evidence
5. **Move** from "In Progress" to "Completed Tasks"
6. **Update** "Next Tasks" based on discoveries

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Task Template:
```
- [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] [Task ID] - Task Description
  - Artifacts: [List of files created/modified]
  - Evidence: [Validation results, quality gate status]
  - Next Actions Triggered: [Related tasks added to queue]
```

### Completed:
<!-- AI will populate this section -->

_No tasks completed yet. This is the initial setup._

## 🔄 In Progress

### Current Task:
<!-- AI updates this section when starting a task -->

_No active tasks._

## 📝 Next Tasks (Priority Queue)

### High Priority:
<!-- AI maintains this queue, updating after each task -->

1. **[TASK-001]** Initial Artifacts Directory Scan
   - Scan all subdirectories in `.artifacts/`
   - Catalog all UPG folders (UPG01-UPG10+)
   - Identify protocol artifacts
   - Map validation artifacts
   - Output: `artifacts-catalog.json`

2. **[TASK-002]** Meta-Upgrades Analysis
   - Analyze each UPG folder structure
   - Identify completion status per UPG
   - Check for alignment.md, analysis.json, intent.json, decision.json
   - Output: `meta-upgrades-status-report.md`

3. **[TASK-003]** Protocol Artifacts Inventory
   - Catalog all protocol-XX folders
   - Identify associated scripts and validation
   - Map protocol dependencies
   - Output: `protocol-inventory.json`

### Medium Priority:
<!-- To be populated as work progresses -->

### Low Priority:

## 📈 Analysis Results

### Artifacts Directory Structure:
```
.artifacts/
├── governance-index.json          [Status: Cataloged]
├── meta-upgrades/                 [Status: Needs Analysis]
│   ├── UPG01-UPG10/              [Status: Partial - need completion check]
│   ├── catalog/

└── validation/                    [Status: Needs Mapping]
```

### Key Findings:
<!-- AI populates this as analysis progresses -->

- **Governance System:** Present (governance-index.json)
- **Meta-Upgrades:** 10 UPG folders detected
- **Protocols:** Multiple protocol artifacts found
- **Validation:** Dedicated validation directory exists

### Gaps Identified:
<!-- AI documents gaps found during analysis -->

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Each task is considered complete when:

1. ✅ **Execution Complete:** All defined steps executed
2. ✅ **Evidence Documented:** Results captured in artifacts
3. ✅ **Quality Validated:** Meets defined quality gates
4. ✅ **This File Updated:** Task moved to "Completed" section
5. ✅ **Next Tasks Updated:** Dependencies/follow-ups added to queue

---

## 🔧 Agent Operation Guidelines

### DO:
- ✅ Read this file FIRST before any action
- ✅ Update this file AFTER every task
- ✅ Document all findings comprehensively
- ✅ Break large tasks into smaller atomic units
- ✅ Validate work against quality gates
- ✅ Maintain clear audit trail

### DON'T:
- ❌ Skip updating this file
- ❌ Work without consulting "Next Tasks"
- ❌ Leave tasks in "In Progress" indefinitely
- ❌ Create duplicate work (check "Completed" first)
- ❌ Make assumptions - document uncertainties
- ❌ Proceed without validating prerequisites

## 📖 Quick Reference

### Task Status Lifecycle:
```
Next Tasks → In Progress → Completed Tasks
     ↑            ↓
     └────────────┘
   (new tasks discovered)
```

### File Update Frequency:
- **Before starting work:** Read entire file
- **When starting task:** Update "In Progress"
- **When completing task:** Move to "Completed", update "Next Tasks"
- **When discovering new work:** Add to "Next Tasks"

### Evidence Standards:
- All work must produce tangible artifacts
- Validation results must be documented
- Quality gate status must be explicit
- File paths must be absolute and verified
