## Quality Assurance Checklist
### Before Protocol Creation
- [x] PRD requirements reviewed
- [x] Template structure understood  
- [x] Validation scripts available
- [x] Directory structure ready

### During Protocol Creation
- [x] All 10 sections included
- [x] Workflow steps clear and actionable
- [x] Quality gates measurable
- [x] Automation scripts specified
- [x] Evidence artifacts defined

### After Protocol Creation
- [x] Self-review completed
