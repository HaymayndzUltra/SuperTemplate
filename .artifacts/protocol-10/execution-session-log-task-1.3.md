## Execution Progress

### Current Phase: STEP 1 - Pre-Execution Alignment

**[MASTER RAY™ | PHASE 1 START]** - Preparing to execute parent task **1.3: Authentication Infrastructure**

**Task Selection Reasoning:**
- **Premises:** Tasks must be executed in priority order with clear scope boundaries
- **Constraints:** Resource availability, dependency completion, governance compliance
- **Decision:** Task 1.3 selected as next critical task after Task 1.2 completion
- **Evidence:** Task file shows Task 1.3 as next task in critical path
- **Risks & Mitigations:**
  * **Risk:** Frontend project not initialized → **Mitigation:** Check and initialize if needed before proceeding
  * **Risk:** Supabase Auth not configured → **Mitigation:** Verify Supabase Auth configuration from Task 1.1
  * **Risk:** JWT validation complexity → **Mitigation:** Follow security best practices, use python-jose library

### Quality Gate Plan:
- **Preflight Confirmation Gate:** Task selection, model confirmation, environment validation
- **Subtask Compliance Gate:** Rule references, evidence capture, quick validations
- **Parent Task Quality Gate:** Comprehensive audit, CI checks, issue resolution
- **Session Closure Gate:** Task state sync, evidence manifest, next session brief
