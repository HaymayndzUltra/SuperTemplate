## Commit Decisions

### Commit Strategy Recommendation:
**Granular Commits** - Keep separate commits for:
1. Task file updates
2. Evidence artifacts
3. Execution logs

**Rationale:**
- Clear audit trail for task completion
- Evidence artifacts should be committed separately for traceability
- Execution logs provide historical context

### Commit Messages Proposed:
1. `feat(protocol-10): Complete Task 1.1 - Project Setup & Configuration`
2. `docs(protocol-10): Add evidence for Task 1.1 subtasks`
3. `chore(protocol-10): Update execution session log for Task 1.1`

**Awaiting confirmation before executing commits.**
