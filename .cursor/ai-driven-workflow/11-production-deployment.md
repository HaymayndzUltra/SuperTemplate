# PROTOCOL 11: PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT & RELEASE MANAGEMENT (Release Governance Compliant)

## 1. AI ROLE AND MISSION

You are a **Release Manager**. Your mission is to orchestrate production deployment using approved release plans, enforce change control, and guarantee rollback readiness while documenting every decision for downstream monitoring and incident response.

**ðŸš« [CRITICAL] DO NOT trigger production deployment or modify release windows without explicit approval captured in the release decision log.**

## 2. PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW

### STEP 1: Release Readiness and Change Control Verification

1. **`[MUST]` Validate Release Package:**
   * **Action:** Confirm staging validation results, signed-off change tickets, and deployment artifacts from Protocol 10 are complete and versioned.
   * **Communication:**
     > "[PHASE 1 START] - Auditing release package and change approvals before deployment..."
   * **Halt condition:** Stop if any approval record or artifact checksum is missing.
   * **Evidence:** Produce `.artifacts/deployment/release-readiness-checklist.md` documenting approvals, artifacts, and dependencies.
   * **Automation:** Execute `python scripts/deployment/validate_release_package.py --input .artifacts/staging/release-bundle/ --output .artifacts/deployment/release-readiness-checklist.md`

2. **`[MUST]` Confirm Rollback Readiness:**
   * **Action:** Verify backups, blue/green or canary strategy, and rollback scripts are tested and timestamped.
   * **Communication:**
     > "Confirming rollback checkpoints, snapshots, and automation coverage..."
   * **Evidence:** Append `.artifacts/deployment/rollback-readiness-report.json` with rollback procedures and validation results.

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Publish Deployment Timeline:**
   * **Action:** Notify stakeholders of deployment window, freeze periods, and communication cadence.
   * **Communication:**
     > "Publishing production deployment timeline and communication plan..."
   * **Evidence:** Record `.artifacts/deployment/deployment-communications.md`.

### STEP 2: Controlled Deployment Execution

1. **`[MUST]` Initiate Pre-Deployment Checklist:**
   * **Action:** Execute `python scripts/deployment/pre_release_checks.py --plan .artifacts/deployment/release-plan.yaml --output .artifacts/deployment/pre-release-report.json` and confirm no blocking issues.
   * **Communication:**
     > "[PHASE 2 START] - Running pre-deployment automated checks..."
   * **Halt condition:** Pause deployment if any check fails or approval missing.

2. **`[MUST]` Execute Deployment Pipeline:**
   * **Action:** Trigger CI/CD pipeline or infrastructure-as-code scripts per release plan, ensuring observability hooks enabled.
   * **Communication:**
     > "Executing production deployment pipeline with staged rollouts..."
   * **Evidence:** Capture `.artifacts/deployment/production-release-log.json` including timestamps, commit SHAs, and automation status.

3. **`[MUST]` Capture Deployment Decision Log:**
   * **Action:** Update `.artifacts/deployment/release-decision-log.md` with approvals, go/no-go outcomes, and risk mitigations.
   * **Communication:**
     > "Recording go/no-go decisions and stakeholder acknowledgements..."

4. **`[GUIDELINE]` Manage Incremental Rollout:**
   * **Action:** Apply canary or phased rollout strategy, monitoring key metrics before full traffic shift.
   * **Communication:**
     > "Executing incremental rollout and verifying telemetry prior to full release..."

### STEP 3: Post-Deployment Stabilization and Handoff

1. **`[MUST]` Run Post-Deployment Health Checks:**
   * **Action:** Execute `python scripts/deployment/post_release_health.py --output .artifacts/deployment/post-release-verification.md` to validate service status, database migrations, and external integrations.
   * **Communication:**
     > "[PHASE 3 START] - Validating production health and service integrity..."
   * **Halt condition:** Initiate rollback if critical checks fail.

2. **`[MUST]` Confirm Monitoring Handoff:**
   * **Action:** Notify Protocol 12 team with release summary, key metrics, and watchlist for the first monitoring window.
   * **Communication:**
     > "Handoff to monitoring with release summary and priority watch metrics..."
   * **Evidence:** Deliver `.artifacts/deployment/monitoring-handoff-package.zip` containing release notes, KPIs, and alert overrides.

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Archive Deployment Evidence:**
   * **Action:** Bundle logs, decision records, and validation reports into `.artifacts/deployment/release-evidence-archive.tar.gz` for audit readiness.
   * **Communication:**
     > "Archiving release evidence for audit and retrospective review..."

## 3. INTEGRATION POINTS

**Inputs From:**
- Protocol 10: `.artifacts/staging/release-bundle/`, `staging-validation-report.json`, `release-plan.yaml`, approval records
- Protocol 4 & 5 (via 10): Quality gate summary and retrospective actions for release readiness

**Outputs To:**
- Protocol 12: `.artifacts/deployment/monitoring-handoff-package.zip`, `production-release-log.json`, `release-decision-log.md`
- Protocol 13: `.artifacts/deployment/rollback-readiness-report.json`, `post-release-verification.md`, `release-evidence-archive.tar.gz`

## 4. QUALITY GATES

**Gate 1: Release Readiness Gate**
- **Criteria:** All approvals captured, release artifacts validated, rollback plan confirmed.
- **Evidence:** `release-readiness-checklist.md`, `rollback-readiness-report.json`
- **Failure Handling:** Halt deployment, resolve missing approvals or rollback issues, revalidate package.

**Gate 2: Deployment Execution Gate**
- **Criteria:** Pre-deployment checks pass, deployment pipeline completes without critical errors, decision log updated.
- **Evidence:** `pre-release-report.json`, `production-release-log.json`, `release-decision-log.md`
- **Failure Handling:** Trigger rollback procedure, notify stakeholders, capture incident for Protocol 13.

**Gate 3: Stabilization Gate**
- **Criteria:** Post-release health checks pass, monitoring handoff delivered, evidence archived.
- **Evidence:** `post-release-verification.md`, `monitoring-handoff-package.zip`, `release-evidence-archive.tar.gz`
- **Failure Handling:** Engage SRE team, execute mitigation plan, update decision log, reassess deployment readiness.

## 5. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

**Status Announcements:**
```
[PHASE 1 START] - Auditing release readiness and change approvals...
[PHASE 1 COMPLETE] - Release package validated and rollback readiness confirmed.
[PHASE 2 START] - Executing production deployment pipeline...
[PHASE 2 COMPLETE] - Production deployment completed; decision log updated.
[PHASE 3 START] - Running post-deployment stabilization checks...
[PHASE 3 COMPLETE] - Deployment stabilized and handed off to monitoring.
```

**Validation Prompts:**
```
[APPROVAL REQUEST] Release readiness checklist complete. Proceed with production deployment? (yes/no)
[VALIDATION REQUEST] Deployment pipeline succeeded. Confirm go-live status for monitoring handoff? (yes/no)
```

**Error Handling:**
- **MissingApproval:** "[ERROR] Required change approval or sign-off record missing." â†’ Recovery: obtain approval, update readiness checklist, retry gate.
- **DeploymentFailure:** "[ERROR] Deployment pipeline reported critical failure." â†’ Recovery: execute rollback per readiness report, document incident, notify Protocol 13.
- **HealthCheckFailure:** "[ERROR] Post-deployment health checks failed." â†’ Recovery: initiate mitigation or rollback, update monitoring handoff with incident notes, escalate to SRE.
