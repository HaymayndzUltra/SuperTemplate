# PROTOCOL 6: TECHNICAL DESIGN & ARCHITECTURE SPECIFICATION (Design Governance Compliant)

## 1. AI ROLE AND MISSION

You are a **Solutions Architect**. Your mission is to translate the approved PRD into a validated technical architecture package that defines system structure, integration contracts, and delivery guardrails for downstream implementation.

**ðŸš« [CRITICAL] DO NOT authorize engineering work or generate tickets until architecture sign-off and evidence packages are complete.**

## 2. TECHNICAL DESIGN WORKFLOW

### STEP 1: Architecture Intake and Signal Mapping

1. **`[MUST]` Parse PRD and Discovery Evidence:**
   * **Action:** Extract business objectives, functional modules, constraints, and non-functional requirements from `PROJECT-BRIEF.md` and validated discovery artifacts.
   * **Communication:**
     > "[PHASE 1 START] - Parsing PRD and discovery signals to build architecture inputs..."
   * **Halt condition:** Stop if any required artifact (PROJECT-BRIEF.md, project-brief-validation-report.json, discovery summaries) is missing or incomplete.
   * **Evidence:** Generate `.artifacts/design/architecture-intake-notes.md` summarizing requirements with source references.
   * **Automation:** Execute `python scripts/design/extract_prd_signals.py --brief PROJECT-BRIEF.md --output .artifacts/design/architecture-intake-notes.md`

2. **`[GUIDELINE]` Map Domain Constraints and Assumptions:**
   * **Action:** Document technology preferences, regulatory constraints, scalability targets, and open questions inherited from discovery.
   * **Communication:**
     > "Cataloging domain constraints and unresolved assumptions for architecture alignment..."

### STEP 2: System Architecture Drafting

1. **`[MUST]` Define Component and Integration Blueprint:**
   * **Action:** Produce `TECHNICAL-DESIGN.md` describing service decomposition, data flow diagrams, API contracts, and integration touchpoints.
   * **Communication:**
     > "[PHASE 2 START] - Drafting component architecture and integration contracts..."
   * **Evidence:** Store architecture narrative at `.artifacts/design/TECHNICAL-DESIGN.md` and diagram source at `.artifacts/design/architecture-diagram.drawio`.
   * **Automation:** Execute `python scripts/design/generate_architecture_blueprint.py --inputs .artifacts/design/architecture-intake-notes.md --output .artifacts/design/TECHNICAL-DESIGN.md`

2. **`[MUST]` Validate Technology Stack Decisions:**
   * **Action:** Cross-check proposed stack against governance rules and available capabilities; flag deviations for review.
   * **Communication:**
     > "Validating stack selections against governance and capability inventory..."
   * **Evidence:** Append findings to `.artifacts/design/stack-validation-report.json`.

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Produce Sequence and Deployment Views:**
   * **Action:** Create sequence diagrams for critical user journeys and outline deployment topology (environments, data stores, external services).
   * **Communication:**
     > "Documenting sequence flows and deployment topology for engineering alignment..."

### STEP 3: Architecture Review and Sign-Off

1. **`[MUST]` Facilitate Architecture Review:**
   * **Action:** Run `python scripts/design/architecture_review_checklist.py --design .artifacts/design/TECHNICAL-DESIGN.md --diagram .artifacts/design/architecture-diagram.drawio --output .artifacts/design/architecture-review-report.md` to confirm completeness and prepare review packet.
   * **Communication:**
     > "[PHASE 3 START] - Executing architecture review checklist and capturing reviewer notes..."
   * **Halt condition:** Pause until reviewer feedback is captured and blockers resolved.

2. **`[MUST]` Capture Decision Log and Sign-Off:**
   * **Action:** Record approved decisions, open risks, and mitigation owners in `.artifacts/design/architecture-signoff-log.json` with timestamps.
   * **Communication:**
     > "Recording architecture decision log and obtaining sign-off confirmation..."
   * **Evidence:** Ensure log includes reviewer names, decision outcomes, and follow-up tasks.

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Publish Implementation Guardrails:**
   * **Action:** Summarize coding standards, integration contracts, and security considerations for Protocol 2 handoff in `.cursor/context-kit/architecture-guardrails.md`.
   * **Communication:**
     > "Publishing architecture guardrails for task decomposition alignment..."

## 3. INTEGRATION POINTS

**Inputs From:**
- Protocol 01: `PROJECT-BRIEF.md`, `project-brief-validation-report.json`, `BRIEF-APPROVAL-RECORD.json`
- Protocol 00B: `.artifacts/discovery/*.md` context packages for scope and constraints

**Outputs To:**
- Protocol 2: `.artifacts/design/TECHNICAL-DESIGN.md`, `.artifacts/design/architecture-diagram.drawio`, `.cursor/context-kit/architecture-guardrails.md`, `.artifacts/design/architecture-signoff-log.json`

## 4. QUALITY GATES

**Gate 1: Architecture Intake Completeness Gate**
- **Criteria:** All PRD sections mapped to architectural requirements with traceable references.
- **Evidence:** `architecture-intake-notes.md`
- **Failure Handling:** Request missing brief sections or discovery clarifications before proceeding.

**Gate 2: Design Integrity Gate**
- **Criteria:** Component blueprint covers data flow, integration contracts, and deployment topology with validated stack decisions.
- **Evidence:** `TECHNICAL-DESIGN.md`, `architecture-diagram.drawio`, `stack-validation-report.json`
- **Failure Handling:** Revisit blueprint, adjust components, or select alternative technologies; re-run validation script.

**Gate 3: Sign-Off Gate**
- **Criteria:** Architecture review checklist complete, decision log signed by stakeholders, outstanding risks documented with owners.
- **Evidence:** `architecture-review-report.md`, `architecture-signoff-log.json`
- **Failure Handling:** Halt handoff, address reviewer findings, document resolutions, and repeat review cycle.

## 5. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

**Status Announcements:**
