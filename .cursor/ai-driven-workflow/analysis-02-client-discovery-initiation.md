- Meta-heuristic: Actionable exception narratives.

**Step 4:** Self-awareness logs and progress dashboards (ref. L409-L436, L447-L480)
- Reasoning: Canonical self-reporting template and timeline/velocity dashboard.
- Meta-heuristic: Transparent introspection and telemetry reporting.

### Layer 5: Cognitive & Learning Framework
**Step 1:** Reasoning patterns: decomposition, risk triage, adaptive templates (ref. L197-L216)
- Reasoning: Declares primary/secondary/tertiary reasoning modes and improvement loop.
- Meta-heuristic: Explicit meta-reasoning selection.

**Step 2:** Root cause analysis and corrective loop (ref. L269-L286)
- Reasoning: Symptom→Cause→Resolution→Validation pattern with artifacted evidence.
- Meta-heuristic: Structured RCA with auditability.

**Step 3:** Learning mechanisms and feedback loops (client, gates, downstream) (ref. L289-L307)
- Reasoning: Multi-source feedback with thresholds that trigger improvements.

## COMMENTARY
**Architectural Dependencies:**
- Discovery Orchestration provides the foundational workflow that all other subsystems depend on (L46-193)
- Quality Control subsystem validates outputs from Discovery Orchestration before allowing progression (L828-859)
- Evidence Management depends on both Discovery Orchestration (for artifacts) and Quality Control (for validation results) (L1186-1261)
- Cognitive Learning subsystem monitors and improves all other subsystems through feedback loops (L287-405)
- Automation & Integration subsystem provides the technical execution layer for Discovery Orchestration and Quality Control (L907-1074)
- Handoff to Protocol 03 requires successful completion of all subsystems (L1149-1166)

**Meta-Engineering Heuristics:**
- **Deterministic orchestration:** Sequential phase approach ensures predictable, repeatable discovery process
- **Safety-first design:** Multiple validation layers and halt conditions prevent incomplete discovery from progressing
- **Evidence-driven execution:** Every step requires artifact generation and validation, creating comprehensive audit trails
- **Adaptive resilience:** System learns from failures and adapts templates, thresholds, and processes automatically
- **Redundancy through automation + manual:** Critical operations have both automated and manual fallback procedures

**Cognitive Role Modularity:**
- **Planner:** Sequential phase design and prerequisite establishment (L46, L14-31)
- **Executor:** Workflow step execution and artifact generation (L50-192)
- **Validator:** Quality gate implementation and validation scripts (L828-859, L914-1017)
- **Auditor:** Evidence management, traceability, and archival procedures (L1170-1261)
- **Reasoner:** Decision logic frameworks and reasoning patterns (L197-266)
- **Learner:** Feedback loops, knowledge capture, and continuous improvement (L287-801)
- **Adapter:** Meta-cognition, self-correction, and system evolution (L405-570, L661-685)

## INFERENCE SUMMARY
This protocol represents an evidence-driven adaptive discovery framework that transforms proposal acceptance into validated project definition through systematic requirements gathering. The core design philosophy combines sequential gated progression with continuous learning, ensuring high reliability through redundant validation (automated + manual) and strict quality control. Key architectural innovations include a 5-layer cognitive framework with meta-cognition capabilities, comprehensive evidence traceability with 7-year archival retention, and self-improving mechanisms that adapt templates, thresholds, and processes based on execution patterns. The system provides a contractual guarantee that only validated, complete discovery outputs progress to downstream protocols while maintaining organizational learning through systematic knowledge capture and sharing.
