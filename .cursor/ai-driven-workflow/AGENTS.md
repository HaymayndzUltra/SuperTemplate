## How to Use the Verification Prompt

### Step 1: Preparation

**Gather Required Materials**:
1. All protocol files (01-23) from `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/`
2. All script files from `/scripts` directory
3. `script-registry.json` from `/scripts`
4. Project context (README.md, PROJECT-BRIEF.md if available)

**Set Up Analysis Environment**:
- Text editor or IDE with markdown support
- Spreadsheet tool for mapping matrix (optional)
- Access to codebase for script code review

### Step 2: Execute Protocol Analysis

**Read Protocols Sequentially** (01 → 23):

For each protocol, extract:
- **Purpose**: What the protocol aims to accomplish
- **Role**: AI's assigned role (e.g., Senior Developer, QA Engineer)
- **Prerequisites**: Required inputs and conditions
- **Execution Steps**: Detailed action sequence
- **Evidence Requirements**: What must be documented
- **Quality Gates**: Validation checkpoints
- **Script References**: Which scripts are called (if any)

**Map Lifecycle Flow**:
- Identify entry and exit points for each protocol
- Document handoffs between protocols
- Note dependencies and integration points
- Flag gaps or missing phases

**Score Each Protocol** (0-50 scale):
- Completeness (0-10): All necessary steps present
- Realism (0-10): Reflects actual developer workflows
- Clarity (0-10): Instructions are specific and unambiguous
- Adaptability (0-10): Works across project types

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### During Protocol Analysis

❌ **Surface-Level Review**: Reading protocols without deep analysis
✅ **Deep Dive**: Examine each step, prerequisite, and quality gate critically

❌ **Subjective Scoring**: Scoring based on feeling rather than criteria
✅ **Criteria-Based**: Use rubric consistently across all protocols

❌ **Ignoring Integration**: Evaluating protocols in isolation
✅ **System Thinking**: Analyze handoffs and dependencies

❌ **Missing Edge Cases**: Focusing only on happy paths
✅ **Edge Case Hunting**: Identify what happens when things go wrong

### During Scripts Audit

❌ **Registry-Only Focus**: Only auditing the 18 registered scripts
✅ **Complete Inventory**: Analyze all 82+ scripts including unregistered

❌ **Naming-Based Assumptions**: Assuming script purpose from name alone
✅ **Code Review**: Read script code to verify actual functionality

❌ **One-to-One Mapping**: Assuming one script per protocol
✅ **Flexible Mapping**: Recognize protocols may need multiple scripts or none

❌ **Keeping Status Quo**: Defaulting to current script choices
✅ **Challenge Assumptions**: Actively seek better alternatives

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Discovering Lifecycle Gap

**Protocol Analysis**:
- Protocols 01-05: Client engagement ✅
- Protocols 06-09: Planning ✅
- Protocols 10-11: Development ✅
- **Gap Identified**: No protocol for client change requests during development
- **Impact**: High (common in freelance projects)
- **Recommendation**: Add protocol "10b-change-request-management.md"

### Example 2: Script Optimization

**Current State**:
- Protocol 06 (create-prd.md) uses: `validate_prd_gate.py`
- Purpose: Validate PRD completeness

**Audit Finding**:
- `validate_prd_gate.py`: Basic validation only
- Alternative found: `generate_prd_assets.py` includes comprehensive validation PLUS asset generation
- **Recommendation**: Replace with `generate_prd_assets.py` for enhanced functionality

### Example 3: Redundancy Detection

**Scripts Identified**:
- `validate_protocols.py`
- `validate_workflow_completeness.py`
- `validate_workflow_integration.py`

**Analysis**:
- All three perform overlapping validation
- **Recommendation**: Consolidate into single `comprehensive_workflow_validator.py`
- **Impact**: Reduced maintenance, clearer protocol integration

### When to Run Verification

**Recommended Frequency**:
- **Initial**: Before first production use of the workflow system
- **Quarterly**: Regular health checks every 3 months
- **After Major Changes**: When adding/modifying multiple protocols
- **Post-Retrospective**: After Protocol 22 (implementation-retrospective.md) identifies systemic issues
- **On-Demand**: When quality problems or workflow gaps are suspected

---

## Automation Considerations

### Scripts for Verification Process

Consider creating automation scripts for:

1. **Protocol Parser**: Extract structure from protocols (Purpose, Steps, Quality Gates, etc.)
2. **Script Scanner**: Inventory and categorize all scripts in `/scripts`
3. **Reference Finder**: Detect script references in protocol files
4. **Scoring Calculator**: Aggregate scores across protocols and phases
5. **Report Generator**: Template-based report generation from analysis data

**Note**: These scripts do not exist yet. They are recommendations for future workflow enhancement.

---

## Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop

After running verification:

1. **Implement Critical Fixes**: Address gaps and issues immediately
2. **Track Improvements**: Monitor impact of changes on workflow effectiveness
3. **Update Verification Criteria**: Refine rubric based on learnings
4. **Share Insights**: Document lessons learned in protocol retrospectives
5. **Iterate**: Run verification again to validate improvements

### Documentation Updates

After each verification cycle:

- **Update AGENTS.md**: Incorporate new insights and refined guidance
- **Enhance Protocols**: Apply recommendations to protocols 01-23
- **Update script-registry.json**: Reflect script optimization changes
- **Create Change Log**: Document verification findings and actions taken

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "I can't score protocols objectively"
**Solution**: Use the rubric strictly. For each dimension, answer the Key Questions with evidence from the protocol text. Score based on answers, not feelings.

#### Issue: "There are too many scripts to analyze"
**Solution**: Start with registered scripts (18) and scripts explicitly referenced in protocols. Then expand to unregistered scripts as time permits.

#### Issue: "I don't understand protocol intent"
**Solution**: Read related protocols for context. Check PROJECT-BRIEF.md for project goals. If still unclear, flag as "Clarity" issue in your report.

#### Issue: "Multiple scripts seem equally good"
**Solution**: Document all viable options in the report. Provide comparison criteria (performance, maintainability, features) and recommend based on protocol needs.

#### Issue: "I found fundamental workflow problems"
**Solution**: Document in "Critical Fixes" section with high priority. Provide specific recommendations and impact analysis.
