## PHASE MAP
### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions
**Step 1:** Protocol Charter and Phase Alignment (ref. L6-L13)
- Reasoning: `PROTOCOL 01` defines Phase 0 focus and clarifies the transformation objective from job posts to client-ready proposals, establishing macro scope before execution.
- Meta-heuristic: Anchor every workflow to an explicit mission and phase classification to constrain downstream interpretation.

**Step 2:** Freelance Solutions Architect Role Mandate (ref. L32-L35)
- Reasoning: The protocol assigns the AI the role of "Freelance Solutions Architect" with a mission to produce truthful, human-centric proposals, setting primary identity and responsibilities.
- Meta-heuristic: Codify agent identity and mission to ensure consistent decision-making perspective.

**Step 3:** Non-Fabrication Governance Constraint (ref. L36-L37)
- Reasoning: The critical prohibition against fabricating experience or guarantees establishes a hard governance boundary that supersedes opportunistic responses.
- Meta-heuristic: Enforce safety-critical guardrails that override opportunistic optimization when evidence is absent.

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control
**Step 1:** Prerequisite Compliance Gate (ref. L14-L29)
- Reasoning: Required artifacts, approvals, and system state checks must be satisfied before execution, providing a clear entry gate.
- Meta-heuristic: Require explicit readiness validation to prevent execution under unknown or unsupported conditions.

**Step 2:** Embedded Halt Conditions per Workflow Step (ref. L45-L109)
- Reasoning: Each workflow phase defines halt triggers (missing job post, low tone confidence, incomplete sections, validation discrepancies) that stop progression until cleared.
- Meta-heuristic: Integrate checkpoint-driven stop rules inside procedures to maintain control over partial outputs.

**Step 3:** Quality Gates 1-5 Enforcement (ref. L256-L298)
- Reasoning: Five formal gates with criteria, evidence, thresholds, failure handling, and automation commands govern progression from intake through compliance.
- Meta-heuristic: Layer deterministic gate structures with measurable pass criteria to certify readiness.

**Step 4:** Pre-Handoff Verification Checklist (ref. L411-L420)
- Reasoning: The handoff section mandates confirmation of prerequisites, workflow completion, gate passage, evidence capture, integration outputs, automation, and communication logs before closure.
- Meta-heuristic: Close protocols only after multipoint verification to protect downstream consumers.

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic
**Step 1:** Discovery Context Intake Procedure (ref. L42-L59)
- Reasoning: Step 1 directs parsing `JOB-POST.md`, storing analysis artifacts, and reviewing existing discovery notes to build contextual grounding.
- Meta-heuristic: Initiate execution with structured evidence extraction and context cross-referencing.

**Step 2:** Tone and Strategy Mapping Pipeline (ref. L61-L77)
- Reasoning: Step 2 executes tone detection, strategy selection, and differentiator curation with associated evidence outputs and thresholds.
- Meta-heuristic: Translate qualitative client signals into governed strategy inputs before drafting deliverables.

**Step 3:** Proposal Drafting and Humanization Execution (ref. L78-L101)
- Reasoning: Step 3 mandates generating `PROPOSAL.md`, applying humanization filters, and documenting optional value adds with evidence artifacts.
- Meta-heuristic: Couple structured authoring with empathy calibration to balance precision and rapport.

**Step 4:** Validation and Reviewer Preparation Loop (ref. L102-L119)
- Reasoning: Step 4 runs validation suites and prepares reviewer summaries, ensuring findings feed stakeholders.
- Meta-heuristic: Integrate validation and briefing outputs to streamline approval workflows.

**Step 5:** Automation and CI/CD Hooks (ref. L341-L383)
- Reasoning: The automation section lists scripts, registry references, CI workflow steps, and enforcement commands that mechanize validation.
- Meta-heuristic: Externalize procedural steps into reusable automation with documented invocation contexts.

**Step 6:** Evidence Summary and Traceability Matrix (ref. L436-L485)
- Reasoning: The evidence summary tabulates artifacts, traceability, verification chains, and quality metrics that bind execution outputs to consumers.
- Meta-heuristic: Maintain end-to-end traceability and retention to support auditability and downstream reuse.

**Step 7:** Manual Fallback Procedures (ref. L389-L394)
- Reasoning: Manual validation steps provide resilience when automation is unavailable, specifying documentation requirements.
- Meta-heuristic: Design procedural redundancies that preserve evidence continuity under degraded automation.

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar
**Step 1:** Phase Status Announcements (ref. L303-L311)
- Reasoning: Standardized phase messages broadcast execution progression and completion with evidence pointers.
- Meta-heuristic: Use deterministic status signaling to synchronize human stakeholders with protocol state.

**Step 2:** Formal Validation Confirmation Prompt (ref. L313-L323)
- Reasoning: The confirmation prompt enumerates completed artifacts and requests consent to proceed to Protocol 02.
- Meta-heuristic: Employ consent-driven confirmation dialogs to transition ownership between protocols.

**Step 3:** Error Escalation Template (ref. L326-L337)
- Reasoning: Error messaging prescribes failure context, required action, and options for remediation, waiver, or halt.
- Meta-heuristic: Provide structured escalation narratives that preserve choice architecture and traceability.

**Step 4:** In-Procedure Communication Cues (ref. L46-L91)
- Reasoning: Workflow steps include scripted communications (e.g., phase start notices, automation alerts) that align narrative with execution.
- Meta-heuristic: Embed communication checkpoints inside procedures to maintain consistent external messaging.

### Layer 5: Cognitive & Learning Framework
**Step 1:** Reasoning Pattern Declaration (ref. L491-L503)
- Reasoning: The protocol specifies primary and secondary reasoning patterns plus improvement tracking for reasoning efficacy.
- Meta-heuristic: Explicitly declare cognitive modes to monitor and refine problem-solving behaviors.

**Step 2:** Execution Readiness Decision Logic (ref. L506-L519)
- Reasoning: Decision Point 1 enumerates criteria, outcomes, and logging for determining whether to proceed or halt.
- Meta-heuristic: Formalize decision gates with documented criteria to standardize readiness judgments.

**Step 3:** Root Cause Analysis Framework (ref. L522-L538)
- Reasoning: A five-step RCA template captures blockers, analysis, resolution, prevention, and validation.
- Meta-heuristic: Institutionalize continuous diagnosis loops that feed corrective action back into the protocol.

**Step 4:** Feedback and Improvement Tracking Loops (ref. L542-L556)
- Reasoning: Feedback collection, metrics tracking, template evolution, and effectiveness measurement define ongoing performance monitoring.
- Meta-heuristic: Couple execution telemetry with iterative improvement cadences.

**Step 5:** Adaptive Knowledge and Meta-Cognition Protocols (ref. L559-L603)
- Reasoning: Knowledge base integration, adaptation mechanisms, self-awareness statements, process monitoring, self-correction, and continuous improvement schedules are detailed for holistic learning.
- Meta-heuristic: Sustain adaptive governance by integrating knowledge capture, self-monitoring, and correction routines.
