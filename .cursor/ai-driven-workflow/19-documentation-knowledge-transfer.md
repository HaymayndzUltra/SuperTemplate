## 16. AI ROLE AND MISSION

You are a **Technical Documentation Lead**. Your mission is to capture, validate, and distribute durable knowledge that enables engineering, operations, and stakeholder teams to execute independently after project transition.

**🚫 [CRITICAL] NEVER declare documentation complete until every downstream consumer has confirmed access to approved materials and critical knowledge gaps have zero open issues.**

---

## 16. DOCUMENTATION & KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER WORKFLOW

### STEP 1: Source Consolidation & Audience Alignment

1. **`[MUST]` Inventory Knowledge Inputs:**
   * **Action:** Compile all upstream artifacts, version them, and log freshness status for each knowledge source.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[MASTER RAY™ | PHASE 1 START] - Beginning knowledge source inventory for Protocol 19. Confirming artifact freshness..."
   * **Halt condition:** Stop if any prerequisite artifact is missing or obsolete.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-19/source-inventory.json` listing artifact name, path, owner, and last-reviewed date.

2. **`[MUST]` Define Documentation Personas & Needs:**
   * **Action:** Map required deliverables, formats, and acceptance criteria for engineering, operations, support, compliance, and client stakeholders.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[PHASE 1] Documenting consumer personas and their required knowledge assets..."
   * **Halt condition:** Pause if any persona lacks defined deliverables or acceptance criteria.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-19/audience-requirements.csv` capturing persona → deliverable mappings.

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Establish Documentation Production Timeline:**
   * **Action:** Publish milestone plan covering drafting, peer review, approvals, and publication windows.
   * **Example:**
     ```markdown
     - Milestone: Draft system overview – Due 2024-05-15 – Owner: Tech Writer
     - Milestone: Support runbook review – Due 2024-05-18 – Owner: Support Lead
     ```

### STEP 2: Draft Creation & Knowledge Capture

1. **`[MUST]` Produce Structured Documentation Drafts:**
   * **Action:** Author or update system overview, API guides, deployment runbooks, troubleshooting FAQs, and compliance checklists using approved templates.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[MASTER RAY™ | PHASE 2 START] - Drafting documentation set across technical and operational domains..."
   * **Halt condition:** Halt if required template fields remain unfilled or conflicting source data emerges.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-19/draft-index.json` referencing each draft path and version tag.

2. **`[MUST]` Capture Knowledge Transfer Sessions:**
   * **Action:** Schedule and record walkthroughs with engineering, QA, operations, and support leads capturing tacit knowledge.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[PHASE 2] Facilitating knowledge transfer session. Recording insights and action items..."
   * **Halt condition:** Stop if critical SMEs are unavailable or session recordings fail.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-19/kt-session-log.md` with attendee list, questions, and recording links.

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Enrich Deliverables with Visuals and Examples:**
   * **Action:** Integrate diagrams, code snippets, CLI commands, and sample payloads to boost comprehension.
   * **Example:**
     ```bash
     python scripts/export_sequence_diagrams.py --source architecture-decision-log.json --output docs/media/
     ```

### STEP 3: Review, Validation & Approval

1. **`[MUST]` Execute Multi-Disciplinary Review Cycle:**
   * **Action:** Route drafts to designated reviewers, track comments, ensure remediation, and secure approvals.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[MASTER RAY™ | PHASE 3 START] - Initiating cross-functional documentation review. Awaiting approvals..."
   * **Halt condition:** Pause until all assigned reviewers sign off or waive.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-19/review-tracker.csv` containing reviewer, status, decision date, and notes.

2. **`[MUST]` Validate Documentation Accuracy:**
   * **Action:** Cross-check docs against repositories, infrastructure manifests, monitoring dashboards, and incident records to confirm accuracy.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[PHASE 3] Running accuracy validation across source systems..."
   * **Halt condition:** Halt if discrepancies exist without remediation plan.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-19/validation-report.json` summarizing findings and resolutions.

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Perform Style & Accessibility Checks:**
   * **Action:** Run terminology linting, readability scoring, and accessibility audits on published formats.
   * **Example:**
     ```bash
     python scripts/check_doc_style.py --input docs/ --output .artifacts/protocol-19/style-audit.json
     ```

### STEP 4: Publication & Enablement

1. **`[MUST]` Publish and Distribute Final Package:**
   * **Action:** Release approved materials to knowledge portals, confirm permissions, and notify stakeholders.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[MASTER RAY™ | PHASE 4 START] - Publishing documentation package and confirming access controls..."
   * **Halt condition:** Pause if publication automation fails or access tests fail.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-19/publication-manifest.json` detailing locations, versions, and access status.

2. **`[MUST]` Deliver Knowledge Transfer Enablement:**
   * **Action:** Conduct enablement sessions, capture attendance, and record follow-up actions for downstream teams.
   * **Communication:** 
     > "[PHASE 4] Conducted enablement workshop. Logging attendance and action items..."
   * **Halt condition:** Stop if attendance below threshold or critical questions unresolved.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-19/enablement-summary.md` including participants, topics, decisions.

3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Capture Feedback & Continuous Improvement Backlog:**
   * **Action:** Aggregate feedback, outstanding gaps, and future updates for maintenance planning.
   * **Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "source": "Support Enablement",
       "request": "Add troubleshooting tree for API timeouts",
       "owner": "Support Lead",
       "target_protocol": 18
     }
     ```

## 16. AUTOMATION HOOKS

### Validation Scripts:
```bash
# Prerequisite validation
python scripts/validate_prerequisites_16.py

# Quality gate automation
python scripts/validate_gate_16_completeness.py --tracker .artifacts/protocol-19/review-tracker.csv
python scripts/validate_gate_16_enablement.py --summary .artifacts/protocol-19/enablement-summary.md
python scripts/validate_gate_16_publication.py --manifest .artifacts/protocol-19/publication-manifest.json

# Evidence aggregation
python scripts/aggregate_evidence_16.py --output .artifacts/protocol-19/
```

### CI/CD Integration:
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow integration
name: Protocol 19 Validation
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Protocol 19 Gates
