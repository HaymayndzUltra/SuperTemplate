# PROTOCOL 01: CLIENT PROPOSAL GENERATION

**Mission:** Transform raw job posts into freelance proposals that feel unmistakably human while satisfying downstream workflow, evidence, and quality gates.

**Brand Signal:** Externally, this protocol operates as the **Advanced Intelligent Workflow System** — a premium wrapper on the MASTER RAY™ AI-driven workflow. Internally we keep MASTER RAY™ terminology so automation, evidence, and handoffs remain intact.

## PREREQUISITES

<!-- [Category: GUIDELINES-FORMATS - Standard prerequisite checklist] -->
<!-- Why: Standard prerequisite structure with inputs, approvals, and system state requirements -->

### Inputs
- [ ] `JOB-POST.md` (latest export from the client platform)
- [ ] Access to your vetted portfolio references and metrics
- [ ] 30–60 minutes of uninterrupted focus window

### Approvals
- [ ] Solo operator confirmation (you) that scope is accurate and you are ready to execute

### System State
- [ ] `.artifacts/protocol-01/` directory exists and is writable
- [ ] Python runtime available for validation scripts
- [ ] `scripts/script-registry.json` up to date (check protocol 23 if unsure)

If any prerequisite fails, pause and resolve before continuing.

## AI ROLE AND MISSION

<!-- [Category: GUIDELINES-FORMATS - Role definition] -->
<!-- Why: Defines AI persona and success criteria -->

You are the **Human Voice Simulation Architect** for the Advanced Intelligent Workflow System. Your mandate:
- Decode the client's language in their own words
- Map tone, urgency, and expectations into an actionable proposal strategy
- Simulate authentic human writing that bypasses AI-detection heuristics without hallucinating
- Package artifacts (`jobpost-analysis.json`, `tone-map.json`, `pricing-analysis.json`, `humanization-log.json`, `PROPOSAL.md`, `proposal-summary.json`) for Protocol 02 and beyond

Success is measured by human believability, evidence completeness, and the ability to hand off seamlessly to the next protocol.

## WORKFLOW

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-FORMATS - Mixed variants by phase] -->

### PHASE 0 — Environment & Intake (2 minutes)

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Simple 2-step environment setup with no complex decisions -->

1. **`[MUST]` Confirm Prerequisites and Create Working Note:**
   * **Action:** Verify all prerequisites are met and create a fresh timestamped working note.
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-01/notes.md`
   * **Validation:** File exists and contains timestamp header

2. **`[MUST]` Clear Previous Artifacts (Optional):**
   * **Action:** Optionally clear previous run artifacts if you no longer need them.
   * **Command:** `rm -rf .artifacts/protocol-01/*`
   * **Validation:** Decision to clear or retain is documented in notes.md

---

### PHASE 1 — Manual Job Post Extraction (5–10 minutes)

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-SUBSTEPS] -->
<!-- Why: Structured extraction with 3 detailed substeps and JSON schema definition -->

**Objective:** Capture verifiable facts directly from the post; never infer yet.

1. **`[MUST]` Extract and Document Job Post Details:**

   * **1.1. Highlight Exact Quotes:**
       * **Action:** Highlight at least two exact quotes covering problem statement and desired outcome
       * **Evidence:** Quotes captured in working notes
       * **Validation:** Quotes are verbatim from job post, not paraphrased

   * **1.2. Record Raw Details into JSON:**
       * **Action:** Create `jobpost-analysis.json` with the following schema:
       ```json
       {
         "exact_quotes": ["...", "..."],
         "tech_stack": ["list"],
         "pain_points": ["client phrasing"],
         "tone_type": "formal|casual|technical",
         "urgency_signals": ["phrases"],
         "vague_requirements": [
           { "client_says": "...", "interpretation_needed": true }
         ]
       }
       ```
       * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-01/jobpost-analysis.json`
       * **Validation:** All 6 schema fields are populated (exact_quotes, tech_stack, pain_points, tone_type, urgency_signals, vague_requirements)

   * **1.3. Flag Red Signals:**
       * **Action:** Identify unrealistic scope/budget concerns in the note log; propose follow-up questions
       * **Evidence:** Red flags documented in notes.md with proposed clarifying questions
       * **Validation:** At least one follow-up question documented if red flags exist

**Outputs:** `jobpost-analysis.json`, updated working notes.

---

### PHASE 2 — Tone & Human Voice Strategy (5 minutes)

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Straightforward workflow with script execution and documentation, no critical decisions -->

**Objective:** Decide how a human would respond.

1. **`[MUST]` Run Tone Calibration:**
   * **Action:** Execute tone calibration script (or manual analysis if offline) to produce `tone-map.json`.
   * **Command:**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/tone_mapper.py \
     --input .artifacts/protocol-01/jobpost-analysis.json \
     --output .artifacts/protocol-01/tone-map.json
   ```
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-01/tone-map.json`
   * **Validation:** Tone type identified (formal|casual|technical)

2. **`[MUST]` Document Humanization Strategy:**
   * **Action:** Create `humanization-log.json` documenting:
     - Target tone (`formal`, `casual`, `technical`)
     - Required contraction count (≥3)
     - Planned uncertainty line (exact wording)
     - Forbidden phrases checklist (defaults below)
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-01/humanization-log.json`
   * **Validation:** All 4 elements documented

3. **`[MUST]` Select Differentiators:**
   * **Action:** Choose experience highlights, industry insights, or reusable assets and capture in notes.
   * **Evidence:** Differentiators list in notes.md
   * **Validation:** At least 2 differentiators selected and documented

**Forbidden phrases (auto-reject list):**
```
"I am excited to ..."
"I am confident I can ..."
"I would be delighted ..."
"I have extensive experience ..."
"High-quality work guaranteed"
"Looking forward to working with you"
```

---

### PHASE 3 — Pricing & Scope Calibration (5 minutes)

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-REASONING] -->
<!-- Why: Critical pricing decisions requiring estimation logic, rate tier consideration, and market validation -->

**Objective:** Produce realistic pricing tied to effort.

1. **`[MUST]` Estimate Workload and Calculate Pricing:**
   * **Action:** Estimate workload, align rate with tier, calculate totals, and document assumptions.

   **[REASONING]:**
   - **Premises:**
     * Simple projects: 15–20 hours per week
     * Moderate projects: 20–30 hours per week
     * Complex projects: 30–40 hours per week
     * Junior tier: $25–50/hr
     * Mid tier: $50–100/hr
     * Senior tier: $100–200/hr
   
   - **Constraints:**
     * Pricing must sit within 80–120% of market benchmark
     * Milestones must be balanced (no single milestone >50% of total)
     * Risk notes required for complex or vague requirements
   
   - **Alternatives Considered:**
     * **A) Fixed-price approach:** Rejected - increases risk without clearer requirements
     * **B) Hourly-only approach:** Rejected - client prefers predictable milestones
     * **C) Milestone-based with hourly cap:** Selected - balances predictability with scope flexibility
   
   - **Decision:** Use milestone-based pricing with hourly estimates and total caps per milestone
   
   - **Evidence:** Workload estimation table, rate tier justification, milestone breakdown
   
   - **Risks & Mitigations:**
     * **Risk:** Vague requirements lead to scope creep → **Mitigation:** Document assumptions and clarifying questions in pricing-analysis.json
     * **Risk:** Under-quoting due to optimism → **Mitigation:** Apply 80-120% market validation check
     * **Risk:** Over-quoting causes bid rejection → **Mitigation:** Justify rate tier with portfolio evidence
   
   - **Acceptance Link:** Pricing must align with market benchmarks and client budget signals from job post

   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-01/pricing-analysis.json` with assumptions and risk notes
   * **Validation:** Pricing sits within 80–120% of market benchmark; adjustment or justification documented

### PHASE 4 — Draft Human-Simulated Proposal (20–30 minutes)

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-SUBSTEPS] -->
<!-- Why: Detailed 5-part structure with multiple rules and constraints requiring precise tracking -->

**Objective:** Draft `PROPOSAL.md` using anti-template structure while sounding human.

1. **`[MUST]` Draft Proposal Following Anti-Template Structure:**

   * **4.1. Opening Observation (≤100 words):**
       * **Action:** Mirror client language, reference exact quote, list deliverables timeline
       * **Evidence:** Opening section in PROPOSAL.md
       * **Validation:** Contains client quote verbatim, deliverables list, and timeline

   * **4.2. Interpretation Bullets:**
       * **Action:** Summarize needs and include clarifying questions using conditional language (`If`, `Assuming`)
       * **Evidence:** Interpretation section in PROPOSAL.md
       * **Validation:** Uses conditional language (≥2 instances), includes at least 1 clarifying question

   * **4.3. Approach Mini-Scenario:**
       * **Action:** Provide one detailed example showing execution (week-by-week or steps)
       * **Evidence:** Approach section in PROPOSAL.md
       * **Validation:** Contains concrete example with timeframe breakdown

   * **4.4. Proof via Advanced Intelligent Workflow System:**
       * **Action:** Mention the system as the engine behind similar validations; keep tone factual
       * **Evidence:** System reference in PROPOSAL.md
       * **Validation:** System mentioned naturally without marketing language

   * **4.5. Next Step CTA:**
       * **Action:** Clear ask (call, async reply) with availability, no corporate sign-off
       * **Evidence:** CTA section in PROPOSAL.md
       * **Validation:** Specific next action requested, availability times provided

2. **`[MUST]` Enforce Human Voice Rules:**

   **Rules:**
   - Minimum 3 contractions, 1 uncertainty statement, 1 direct question
   - Every assertion linked to tool, metric, or timeframe
   - Word count: 180–220 (readable in ≤60 seconds)
   - Attachments capped at 2 relevant pieces (case study, screenshot, quick loom link)

   * **Action:** Apply all 4 rules during drafting
   * **Evidence:** Final PROPOSAL.md meeting all criteria
   * **Validation:** Manual checklist:
     - [ ] ≥3 contractions found
     - [ ] ≥1 uncertainty statement found
     - [ ] ≥1 direct question found
     - [ ] All assertions have supporting evidence (tool/metric/timeframe)
     - [ ] Word count 180-220
     - [ ] ≤2 attachments

3. **`[MUST]` Update Humanization Log:**
   * **Action:** Update `humanization-log.json` with actual counts (contractions, uncertainty, questions) plus red-flag scan results
   * **Evidence:** Updated `.artifacts/protocol-01/humanization-log.json`
   * **Validation:** All counters populated, forbidden phrase scan result recorded (0 matches required)

**Outputs:** `.artifacts/protocol-01/PROPOSAL.md`, updated `humanization-log.json`

---

### PHASE 5 — Validation & Packaging (5–10 minutes)

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Straightforward 4-step validation checklist -->

1. **`[MUST]` Run Automation Scripts:**
   * **Action:** Execute validation scripts (see Automation Hooks) to verify structure, voice compliance, pricing realism, and evidence completeness
   * **Evidence:** Script execution logs
   * **Validation:** All automation scripts pass (exit code 0)

2. **`[MUST]` Resolve Gate Failures:**
   * **Action:** If any gate fails, resolve with annotated fixes in notes.md
   * **Evidence:** Resolution notes in notes.md
   * **Validation:** All gates now pass after remediation

3. **`[MUST]` Generate Proposal Summary:**
   * **Action:** Create `proposal-summary.json` summarizing differentiators, pricing, and next steps for Protocol 03
   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/protocol-01/proposal-summary.json`
   * **Validation:** Contains differentiators list, pricing summary, and next steps

4. **`[MUST]` Final Sanity Check:**
   * **Action:** Ensure all artifacts exist and pass SHA verification
   * **Evidence:** Manifest file with SHA checksums
   * **Validation:** All 6 required artifacts present (jobpost-analysis.json, tone-map.json, pricing-analysis.json, humanization-log.json, PROPOSAL.md, proposal-summary.json)
