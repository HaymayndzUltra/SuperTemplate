# PROTOCOL 01: CLIENT PROPOSAL GENERATION

**What this does:** Turn job posts into winning proposals that get you hired.

**Time**: 30-60 minutes  
**Goal**: Write proposals that show you understand the client's needs and can deliver

## WHAT YOU NEED

- [ ] `JOB-POST.md` - The job description
- [ ] Your portfolio/past work examples
- [ ] 30-60 minutes of focused time

---

## THE GOAL

Write a proposal that:
- ✅ Shows you read and understood their job post
- ✅ Proves you can do the work (with real examples)
- ✅ Sounds human, not like a template
- ✅ Gets read in 60 seconds (clients skim, not read)

**🚫 RULE: Only mention experience you actually have. Don't lie.**

---

## 3-STEP PROCESS

### STEP 1: Understand the Job (5-10 minutes)

**Read the job post and answer:**
1. What do they actually need? (be specific)
2. What tech/tools are mentioned?
3. What's their timeline?
4. What's their budget range?
5. Are they technical or non-technical?
6. What problems are they trying to solve?

**Red flags to watch for:**
- ❌ Vague requirements ("build a website")
- ❌ Unrealistic budget ($500 for "Uber clone")
- ❌ Impossible timeline ("2 weeks for full app")
- ❌ Too many buzzwords (listing every tech stack)

**If job post is vague:** Ask clarifying questions in your proposal

### STEP 2: Match Their Style (5 minutes)

**Figure out how they communicate:**

**Technical Client** (mentions specific tech, detailed requirements):
- Use technical terms
- Show code/architecture knowledge
- Focus on implementation details

**Business Client** (focuses on outcomes, ROI, deadlines):
- Use simple language
- Focus on results and timeline
- Emphasize reliability and communication

**Startup Founder** (fast-paced, budget-conscious):
- Be direct and concise
- Show you can move fast
- Flexible pricing/milestones

**Enterprise** (formal, compliance-focused):
- Professional tone
- Mention security/compliance
- Structured approach

**Find your edge (pick 1-2):**
- Similar project you've done
- Relevant experience in their industry
- Tools/code you already have
- Specific problem you can solve

### STEP 3: Write the Proposal (20-30 minutes)

## PROPOSAL STRUCTURE (Keep it short!)

### 1. HOOK (First 100 words - CRITICAL)

**Template:**
```markdown
Hi [Name],

I see you need [specific thing from job post]. I've done this before:
[1 relevant example with result/metric].

**What you'll get** ([X] weeks):
✅ [Deliverable 1]
✅ [Deliverable 2]
✅ [Deliverable 3]

**Timeline:** [X weeks]
**Investment:** $[amount] ([X] milestones)
```

**Why this works:**
- Shows you read their post
- Proves you can do it
- Clear deliverables
- Upfront pricing

### 2. APPROACH (100-150 words)

**What to include:**
- How you'll tackle their specific problem
- Your process (keep it simple)
- Communication plan (daily/weekly updates)
- Tools you'll use

**Example:**
```markdown
**My Approach:**

Week 1: [What you'll do]
Week 2: [What you'll do]
Week 3: [What you'll do]

**How we'll work:**
- Daily async updates (Slack/Discord)
- Weekly 30-min sync
- Shared GitHub repo
- You review and approve each milestone
```

### 3. WHY YOU (50-100 words)

**Pick 1-2 differentiators:**
- Relevant past project (with link/screenshot)
- Specific expertise they need
- Tools/code you already have
- Fast turnaround capability

**Example:**
```markdown
**Why me:**
- Built similar fintech app last month (see attached)
- Expert in React + Node (5 years)
- Can start immediately
```

### 4. PRICING (Clear breakdown)

**Calculate realistic pricing:**

```
Step 1: Estimate hours
- Simple: 15-20 hrs/week
- Moderate: 20-30 hrs/week  
- Complex: 30-40 hrs/week

Step 2: Pick your rate
- Junior: $25-50/hr
- Mid: $50-100/hr
- Senior: $100-200/hr

Step 3: Calculate
Total = Hours × Rate

Step 4: Break into milestones
```

**Present it clearly:**
```markdown
**Investment:** $4,500 (3 milestones)
- Milestone 1: [Deliverable] - $1,500
- Milestone 2: [Deliverable] - $1,500  
- Milestone 3: [Deliverable] - $1,500

Payment after each milestone approval.
```

### 5. CALL TO ACTION (20-30 words)

```markdown
Available for a quick call this week to discuss details.

[Your Name]
[Portfolio Link]
[Calendar Link]
```

### 6. OPTIONAL: Attachments (Max 2)

**Only include if relevant:**
- Case study (1 page)
- Sample work (screenshot/link)
- Quick mockup/diagram

**Don't attach:**
- Long PDFs
- Generic portfolios

## HOW THIS CONNECTS TO OTHER PROTOCOLS

### What You Need (Inputs):
- **From Protocol 04**: `JOB-POST.md` - The job description
- **From Protocol 02**: `discovery-brief.md` - Notes from previous client interactions (if any)

### What You Create (Outputs):
- **For Protocol 02**: `PROPOSAL.md` - The actual proposal to send
- **For Protocol 03**: `proposal-summary.json` - Summary for project brief

### Where Files Go:
- `.artifacts/protocol-01/` - All proposal files
- `.cursor/context-kit/` - Your project notes and config

---

## QUALITY CHECKS (GATES)

### Standards We Follow
- **Markdown**: CommonMark v0.30 (standard formatting)
- **JSON**: draft-07 schema (for validation)
- **Security**: HIPAA-compliant (if handling client data)
- **Legal**: FTC truth-in-advertising (don't lie in proposals)

### Check 1: Did We Extract Everything from Job Post?
- **What to check**: Did `jobpost-analysis.json` capture all the important stuff?
  - Goals/objectives
  - What they want delivered
  - How they communicate
  - Risks/problems
- **Pass if**: Analysis is 90%+ complete
- **If it fails**: Ask client for missing info, run analysis again, note the gap
- **Run**: `python3 scripts/analyze_jobpost.py --input JOB-POST.md --output .artifacts/protocol-01/jobpost-analysis.json`

### Check 2: Are We Confident About Their Tone?
- **What to check**: Did we correctly detect how they communicate?
- **Pass if**: Confidence score ≥ 80% and we picked a strategy
- **If it fails**: Manually review the job post, update tone map, run check again
- **Run**: `python3 scripts/tone_mapper.py --input .artifacts/protocol-01/jobpost-analysis.json --output .artifacts/protocol-01/tone-map.json`

### Check 3: Is the Proposal Complete?
- **What to check**: Does `PROPOSAL.md` have all required sections?
  - Each section has ≥ 120 words
  - Sounds human (empathy tokens logged)
- **Pass if**: Structure score ≥ 95%
- **If it fails**: Fill in missing sections, make it sound more human, check again
- **Run**: `python3 scripts/validate_proposal_structure.py --input .artifacts/protocol-01/PROPOSAL.md`

### Check 3.5: Is the Pricing Realistic?
- **What to check**: Is your pricing based on real work hours and market rates?
- **Pass if**:
  - Hourly rate ≤ $400 for solo work
  - Hourly rate ≤ $600 for team work
  - Total price is 80-120% of market rate
  - Pricing matches your actual skill level
- **If it fails**: Recalculate based on realistic hours/week, adjust scope, or explain why you're charging premium
- **Run**: `python3 scripts/validate_pricing.py --input .artifacts/protocol-01/pricing-analysis.json --proposal .artifacts/protocol-01/PROPOSAL.md`
- **How it works**:
  ```python
  # Calculate effective hourly rate
  effective_rate = total_price / (weeks * 40)
  
  # Flag if unrealistic
  if effective_rate > 400 and engagement_type == "solo":
      raise ValidationError("Hourly rate exceeds $400 for solo work")
  
  # Warn if job post budget seems inflated
  if job_post_budget > (calculated_price * 2):
      warn("Job post budget may be inflated - use calculated price")
  ```

### Gate 4: Real Compliance Validation
- **Criteria**: HIPAA compliance check passes, quality gates enforce real thresholds.
- **Evidence**: `.artifacts/protocol-01/compliance-validation-report.json`
- **Pass Threshold**: All compliance checks pass (exit code 0).
- **Failure Handling**: Address compliance issues, fix PHI violations, update security configurations.
- **Automation**: `python3 scripts/check_hipaa.py && python3 scripts/enforce_gates.py`

### Gate 5: Final Validation & Approval Readiness
- **Criteria**: Readability ≥ 90, zero factual discrepancies, empathy coverage ≥ 3 tokens, real validation passed.
- **Evidence**: `.artifacts/protocol-01/proposal-validation-report.json`
- **Pass Threshold**: Validation script returns status `pass` and all real gates pass.
- **Failure Handling**: Address flagged items, capture remediation notes, rerun validation.
- **Automation**: `python3 scripts/validate_proposal.py --input .artifacts/protocol-01/PROPOSAL.md --report .artifacts/protocol-01/proposal-validation-report.json`

## REASONING & COGNITIVE PROCESS

### Reasoning Patterns

**Primary Reasoning Pattern: Systematic Execution**
- Execute protocol steps sequentially with validation at each checkpoint

**Secondary Reasoning Pattern: Quality-Driven Validation**
- Apply quality gates to ensure artifact completeness before downstream handoff

**Pattern Improvement Strategy:**
- Track pattern effectiveness via quality gate pass rates and downstream protocol feedback
- Quarterly review identifies pattern weaknesses and optimization opportunities
- Iterate patterns based on empirical evidence from completed executions

### Decision Logic

#### Decision Point 1: Execution Readiness
**Context:** Determining if prerequisites are met to begin protocol execution

**Decision Criteria:**
- All prerequisite artifacts present
- Required approvals obtained
- System state validated

**Outcomes:**
- Proceed: Execute protocol workflow
- Halt: Document missing prerequisites, notify stakeholders

**Logging:** Record decision and prerequisites status in execution log

### Root Cause Analysis Framework

When protocol execution encounters blockers or quality gate failures:

1. **Identify Symptom:** What immediate issue prevented progress?
2. **Trace to Root Cause:**
   - Was prerequisite artifact missing or incomplete?
   - Did upstream protocol deliver inadequate inputs?
   - Were instructions ambiguous or insufficient?
   - Did environmental conditions fail?
3. **Document in Protocol Execution Log:**
   ```markdown
   **Blocker:** [Description]
   **Root Cause:** [Analysis]
   **Resolution:** [Action taken]
   **Prevention:** [Process/template update to prevent recurrence]
   ```
4. **Implement Fix:** Update protocol, re-engage stakeholders, adjust execution
5. **Validate Fix:** Re-run quality gates, confirm resolution

### Learning Mechanisms

#### Feedback Loops
**Purpose:** Establish continuous feedback collection to inform protocol improvements.

- **Execution feedback:** Collect outcome data after each protocol execution
- **Quality gate outcomes:** Track gate pass/fail patterns in historical logs
- **Downstream protocol feedback:** Capture issues reported by dependent protocols
- **Continuous monitoring:** Automated alerts for anomalies and degradation

#### Improvement Tracking
**Purpose:** Systematically track protocol effectiveness improvements over time.

- **Metrics tracking:** Monitor key performance indicators in quarterly dashboards
- **Template evolution:** Log all protocol template changes with rationale and impact
- **Effectiveness measurement:** Compare before/after metrics for each improvement
- **Continuous monitoring:** Automated alerts when metrics degrade

#### Knowledge Base Integration
**Purpose:** Build and leverage institutional knowledge to accelerate protocol quality.

- **Pattern library:** Maintain repository of successful execution patterns
- **Best practices:** Document proven approaches for common scenarios
- **Common blockers:** Catalog typical issues with proven resolutions
- **Industry templates:** Specialized variations for specific domains

#### Adaptation Mechanisms
**Purpose:** Enable protocol to automatically adjust based on context and patterns.

- **Context adaptation:** Adjust execution based on project type, complexity, constraints
- **Threshold tuning:** Modify quality gate thresholds based on risk tolerance
- **Workflow optimization:** Streamline steps based on historical efficiency data
- **Tool selection:** Choose optimal automation based on available resources

### Meta-Cognition

#### Self-Awareness and Process Awareness
**Purpose:** Enable AI to maintain explicit awareness of execution state and limitations.

**Awareness Statement Protocol:**
At each major execution checkpoint, generate awareness statement:
- Current phase and step status
- Artifacts completed vs. pending
- Identified blockers and their severity
- Confidence level in current outputs
- Known limitations and assumptions
- Required inputs for next steps

#### Process Monitoring and Progress Tracking
**Purpose:** Continuously track execution status and detect anomalies.

- **Progress tracking:** Update execution status after each step
- **Velocity monitoring:** Flag execution delays beyond expected duration
- **Quality monitoring:** Track gate pass rates and artifact completeness
- **Anomaly detection:** Alert on unexpected patterns or deviations

#### Self-Correction Protocols
**Purpose:** Enable autonomous detection and correction of execution issues.

- **Halt condition detection:** Recognize blockers and escalate appropriately
- **Quality gate failure handling:** Generate corrective action plans
- **Anomaly response:** Diagnose and propose fixes for unexpected conditions
- **Recovery procedures:** Maintain execution state for graceful resume

#### Continuous Improvement Integration
**Purpose:** Systematically capture lessons and evolve protocol effectiveness.

- **Retrospective execution:** Conduct after-action reviews post-completion
- **Template review cadence:** Scheduled protocol enhancement cycles
- **Gate calibration:** Periodic adjustment of pass criteria
- **Tool evaluation:** Assessment of automation effectiveness
