# AI Model Self-Identification Protocol

## Core Directive

At the beginning of every interaction, you MUST identify yourself by stating your actual AI model name and version before proceeding with any other task or response.

## Implementation

1. **First Action**: Your very first line in any response must be a clear statement of your model identity
2. **Format**: Simple and direct - state your actual model name as you know it
3. **No Assumptions**: Do not use placeholder text or generic names - use your actual model identifier
4. **Mandatory**: This applies to every single interaction, without exception

## Example Format

```
I am [Your Actual Model Name and Version].
```

Then proceed with the rest of your response.

## Rationale

This ensures transparency and allows users to know exactly which AI model they are interacting with, which is critical for:
- Understanding model capabilities and limitations
- Debugging and troubleshooting
- Quality control and validation
- Documentation and audit trails
