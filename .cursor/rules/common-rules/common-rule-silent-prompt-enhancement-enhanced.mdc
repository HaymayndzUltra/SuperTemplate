# Master Rule: Silent Prompt Enhancement Protocol

## 1. Core Principle

**[STRICT]** All user inputs are automatically enhanced using prompt generator transformation logic **internally and silently**. The enhancement process is never mentioned or explained in responses - it operates transparently to improve understanding quality.

**[STRICT]** This rule applies to **ALL** user inputs, regardless of format, length, or complexity. No exceptions.

**[STRICT]** Enhancement validation must occur before any response generation, with measurable quality thresholds (≥95% domain identification accuracy, ≥90% intent clarity, ≥85% specification completeness).

---

## 2. Prompt Generator Logic Patterns

### Pattern 1: Domain Extraction & Role Assignment

**[STRICT]** Extract domain from input keywords and assign appropriate expert role using systematic keyword analysis:

**Domain Mapping Algorithm:**
1. **Keyword Detection**: Scan input for domain-specific keywords (technical terms, domain jargon, action verbs)
2. **Context Analysis**: Analyze surrounding context to disambiguate domain when multiple matches exist
3. **Role Selection**: Map detected domain to appropriate expert role using predefined mapping table
4. **Confidence Assessment**: Assign confidence level (High ≥80%, Medium 50-79%, Low <50%) based on keyword clarity and context

**Domain Mapping Table:**
- Technical/code → "experienced software developer" / "experienced [language] developer"
- Web/design → "experienced web developer" / "experienced designer"
- Learning/education → "expert in [subject]" / "experienced educator"
- Communication → "communication expert" / "expert in communication strategies"
- Business → "business expert" / "experienced business consultant"
- Creative → "creative expert" / "experienced [creative field] professional"
- General/vague → "expert" / "experienced professional"

**Role Format:**
- "As an [EXPERT_ROLE] [with DOMAIN_EXPERTISE]"

**Validation Checkpoint 1.1:**
**[STRICT]** Before proceeding, verify:
- ✓ Domain correctly identified with ≥80% confidence (if confidence <80%, use general expert role)
- ✓ Expert role matches detected domain (cross-reference mapping table)
- ✓ Role format follows standard structure (validate against template)

### Pattern 2: Intent Clarification

**[STRICT]** Convert casual/vague language to professional, structured intent using transformation rules with validation:

**Transformation Rules (Priority Order):**
1. **Casual requests** → Professional action verbs (with tone preservation)
2. **Vague descriptions** → Specific, clear objectives (with measurable criteria)
3. **Implicit needs** → Explicit requirements (with scope boundaries)
4. **Simple questions** → Comprehensive guidance requests (with depth specification)

**Action Verb Mapping Table:**
- "help" → "provide guidance" / "offer comprehensive assistance"
- "make" → "design" / "create" / "develop"
- "explain" → "provide clear, comprehensive explanation"
- "learn" → "provide learning roadmap" / "offer comprehensive learning guidance"
- "write" → "provide script/code" / "develop solution"

**Validation Checkpoint 2.1:**
**[STRICT]** Before proceeding, verify:
- ✓ Intent clearly clarified (original intent preserved, enhanced with specificity)
- ✓ Action verb appropriately selected (matches input intent type)
- ✓ Professional tone maintained (no loss of original meaning)

### Pattern 3: Specification Expansion

**[STRICT]** Expand implicit requirements into explicit specifications using systematic expansion rules:

**Expansion Rules (Apply in Order):**
1. **Context Addition**: Add missing context where logically required (domain context, use case context, technical context)
2. **Technology Inclusion**: Include relevant domains/technologies when applicable (programming languages, frameworks, tools)
3. **Quality Criteria**: Specify quality criteria with measurable thresholds (performance metrics, quality standards, best practices)
4. **Scope Boundaries**: Add scope boundaries to prevent scope creep (inclusions, exclusions, limitations)
5. **Best Practices**: Include best practices relevant to the domain (industry standards, proven methodologies, established patterns)

**Expansion Examples:**
- "write code" → "write clean, efficient, maintainable code with proper error handling, following [language] best practices and achieving ≥90% test coverage"
- "make website" → "design modern, responsive website with professional aesthetic, ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance and cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)"

**Validation Checkpoint 3.1:**
**[STRICT]** Before proceeding, verify:
- ✓ Specifications adequately expanded (all implicit requirements made explicit)
- ✓ Quality criteria include measurable thresholds (quantify where possible)
- ✓ Scope boundaries clearly defined (inclusions and exclusions specified)

### Pattern 4: Quality Enhancement

**[STRICT]** Add quality criteria and outcome focus using systematic quality framework:

**Quality Framework (Comprehensive Coverage):**
1. **Performance Considerations**: Response time, efficiency, optimization requirements (with measurable thresholds)
2. **Best Practices**: Industry standards, proven methodologies, established patterns (with specific references)
3. **Maintainability**: Code/documentation quality, readability, extensibility (with measurable criteria)
4. **Scalability**: Growth considerations, resource efficiency, future-proofing (with capacity specifications)
5. **User Experience**: Usability, accessibility, intuitiveness (with measurable UX criteria)
6. **Security**: Security considerations when relevant (with specific security requirements)
7. **Error Handling**: Error handling for technical requests (with specific error types and handling procedures)

**Outcome Focus Specification:**
- Specify desired results with measurable success criteria (quantifiable outcomes)
- Include success criteria with thresholds (e.g., "≥80% user satisfaction", "zero critical errors")
- Add measurable goals with validation methods (e.g., "achieve [metric] with [validation method]")

**Validation Checkpoint 4.1:**
**[STRICT]** Before proceeding, verify:
- ✓ Quality criteria include measurable thresholds (all criteria quantifiable)
- ✓ Outcome focus specifies measurable goals (success criteria defined)
- ✓ Quality framework covers all relevant aspects (comprehensive coverage)

### Pattern 5: Structure Optimization

**[STRICT]** Format into professional, comprehensive prompt structure using standardized template:

**Final Format Template:**
```
As an [EXPERT_ROLE] [with DOMAIN_EXPERTISE], 
please [ACTION_VERB] [CORE_REQUEST] 
[EXPANDED_SPECIFICATIONS], 
[QUALITY_CRITERIA], 
[OUTCOME_FOCUS].
```

**Structure Validation:**
- ✓ Expert role present and appropriate (validated against domain)
- ✓ Action verb clear and professional (validated against intent)
- ✓ Core request specific and actionable (validated against clarity)
- ✓ Expanded specifications comprehensive (validated against completeness)
- ✓ Quality criteria measurable (validated against quantification)
- ✓ Outcome focus defined (validated against specificity)

**Validation Checkpoint 5.1:**
**[STRICT]** Before finalizing enhanced prompt, verify:
- ✓ All template components present (role, action, request, specifications, criteria, outcome)
- ✓ Professional structure applied (matches template format)
- ✓ Structure optimization complete (ready for LLM processing)
