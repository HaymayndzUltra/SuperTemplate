# Session Continuation Instructions
Generated: 20251019-140701
Previous Session: 20251019-133340
Protocol Tested: 02

## What Was Tested
- Protocol: Client Discovery Initiation (Protocol 02)
- Logic Validation: Halted at prerequisites; no phase progression.
- Gap Detection: Identified missing client response, approval, communication setup, and discovery templates.
- Error Analysis: No automation executed due to unmet prerequisites; documented blockers in manual log.
- Duplicate Check: Not applicable – discovery artifacts for this session are newly created.

## What Was Fixed
- Added blocker documentation across Protocol 02 evidence files (`client-context-notes.md`, `client-discovery-form.md`, `scope-clarification.md`, `timeline-discussion.md`, `communication-plan.md`, `governance-map.md`, `discovery-recap.md`).
- Logged prerequisite failures in `manual-validation-log.md` and opened risks in `risk-log.md`.

## Verified Artifacts
- `.artifacts/protocol-02/client-context-notes.md`
- `.artifacts/protocol-02/client-discovery-form.md`
- `.artifacts/protocol-02/scope-clarification.md`
- `.artifacts/protocol-02/timeline-discussion.md`
- `.artifacts/protocol-02/communication-plan.md`
- `.artifacts/protocol-02/governance-map.md`
- `.artifacts/protocol-02/risk-log.md`
- `.artifacts/protocol-02/discovery-recap.md`
- `.artifacts/protocol-02/manual-validation-log.md`

## Logic Validation Results
- Structural Logic: Blocked – prerequisites unmet (client reply, approval, communication channel, templates).
- Process Logic: Not evaluated – discovery interview could not start.
- Decision Logic: Not evaluated – governance requires stakeholder input.
- Integration Logic: Not evaluated – downstream protocols awaiting validated discovery outputs.

## Next Session Target
- Protocol: 02 (repeat after prerequisites met).
- Prerequisites: Obtain `client-reply.md`, documented business development approval, proof of scheduled communication, and discovery templates.
- Context Needed: Protocol 01 proposal artifacts (`.artifacts/protocol-01/PROPOSAL.md`, `proposal-summary.json`).
- Expected Outcomes: Resume discovery once prerequisites satisfied; rerun gate automation scripts after collecting validated data.

## Critical Notes
- Do not advance to Protocol 03 until client approval and discovery recap confirmation are recorded in `.artifacts/protocol-02/transcripts/`.
- Ensure discovery templates are restored or replaced with approved alternatives before reattempting Phase 1.
