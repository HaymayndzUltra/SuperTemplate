# Session Continuation Instructions
Generated: 20251019-140541
Previous Session: unspecified
Protocol Tested: 02

## What Was Tested
- Protocol: Client Discovery Initiation (Protocol 02) – prerequisite verification only
- Logic Validation: Halted during Gate 0 because prerequisite artifacts and approvals missing
- Gap Detection: Identified absent client reply, business development approval, communication scheduling proof, discovery templates directory, and prerequisite validation script
- Error Analysis: Command `python scripts/validate_prerequisites_02.py` failed (`No such file or directory`); recorded in manual log
- Duplicate Check: Not applicable – session stopped prior to artifact creation

## What Was Fixed
- Documented blockers in `.artifacts/protocol-02/manual-validation-log.md`

## Verified Artifacts
- `.artifacts/protocol-02/manual-validation-log.md` (captures missing prerequisites and failed automation hook)

## Logic Validation Results
- Structural Logic: Not evaluated – prerequisites incomplete
- Process Logic: Not evaluated – awaiting client inputs and approvals
- Decision Logic: Not evaluated – pending prerequisite fulfillment
- Integration Logic: Not evaluated – dependent artifacts missing

## Next Session Target
- Protocol: 02
- Prerequisites: Obtain client acceptance (`.artifacts/protocol-02/client-reply.md`), document business development lead approval, archive communication scheduling evidence, restore `.templates/discovery/` assets, and implement `scripts/validate_prerequisites_02.py`
- Context Needed: `.artifacts/protocol-01/PROPOSAL.md`, `.artifacts/protocol-01/proposal-summary.json`, and any client correspondence once provided
- Expected Outcomes: Verified prerequisites and successful execution of prerequisite validation script prior to starting Phase 1 communications

## Critical Notes
- Do not advance to Protocol 02 workflow steps until prerequisites above are satisfied and automation hooks are operational.
- Update manual log with remediation progress and rerun prerequisite validation once assets are available.
