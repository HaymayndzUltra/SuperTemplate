Previous Session: 20251019-133340
Protocol Tested: 02

## What Was Tested
- Protocol: Client Discovery Initiation (Protocol 02)
- Logic Validation: Halted at prerequisite gate due to missing client response and approvals.
- Gap Detection: Identified absence of client reply artifact, business development approval, communication channel proof, and discovery templates directory.
- Error Analysis: Automation hook `scripts/validate_prerequisites_02.py` missing; recorded in manual validation log.
- Duplicate Check: Not executed; prerequisites incomplete.

## What Was Fixed
- Manual validation log and risk log initialized to capture prerequisite blockers and automation gap.

## Verified Artifacts
- `.artifacts/protocol-02/manual-validation-log.md`
- `.artifacts/protocol-02/risk-log.md`

## Logic Validation Results
- Structural Logic: Blocked pending prerequisite artifacts.
- Process Logic: Not started.
- Decision Logic: Not started.
- Integration Logic: Not started.

## Next Session Target
- Protocol: 02 (resume once prerequisites satisfied)
- Prerequisites: Provide client reply (`.artifacts/protocol-02/client-reply.md`), business development approval evidence, communication channel confirmation, and discovery templates access or equivalent guidance.
- Context Needed: Protocol 01 outputs (`.artifacts/protocol-01/PROPOSAL.md`, `proposal-summary.json`) once prerequisites cleared.
- Expected Outcomes: Complete discovery phase artifacts after prerequisites and automation hook availability verified.

## Critical Notes
- Escalate missing automation script `validate_prerequisites_02.py` or document alternative validation approach before rerun.
