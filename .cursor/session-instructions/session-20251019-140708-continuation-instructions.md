# Session Continuation Instructions
Generated: 20251019-140708
Previous Session: unspecified
Protocol Tested: 02

## What Was Tested
- Protocol: Client Discovery Initiation (Protocol 02)
- Logic Validation: Halted at Prerequisite Gate due to missing client response, approvals, and discovery templates.
- Gap Detection: Identified absence of `.artifacts/protocol-02/client-reply.md`, documented approval trail, and `.templates/discovery/` resources.
- Error Analysis: Unable to commence Phase 1 because mandatory artifacts unavailable; logged blockers in manual validation log.
- Duplicate Check: Not applicable — session terminated before artifact creation beyond manual log.

## What Was Fixed
- Recorded prerequisite failures and remediation requirements in `.artifacts/protocol-02/manual-validation-log.md` for reviewer visibility.

## Verified Artifacts
- `.artifacts/protocol-02/manual-validation-log.md`

## Logic Validation Results
- Structural Logic: Blocked — prerequisites not satisfied, preventing continuation into Context Alignment.
- Process Logic: Blocked pending client response and approval evidence.
- Decision Logic: Pending — awaiting prerequisite remediation before feature prioritization decisions can be validated.
- Integration Logic: Pending — communication schedule and template access must be established.

## Next Session Target
- Protocol: 02
- Prerequisites: Obtain client reply transcript (`.artifacts/protocol-02/client-reply.md`), business development lead approval, discovery templates under `.templates/discovery/`, and confirmation of scheduled communication channel.
- Context Needed: Review Protocol 01 outputs (`.artifacts/protocol-01/`) once prerequisites are satisfied to resume Context Alignment.
- Expected Outcomes: Re-run prerequisite validation, then proceed with Context Alignment artifacts once gating issues resolved.

## Critical Notes
- Do not announce `[MASTER RAY™ | PHASE 1 START]` until all prerequisites are available and logged with evidence.
- Update manual-validation-log with remediation actions taken during the next session.
