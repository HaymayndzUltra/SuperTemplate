### Recommended Merge Order
1. **PR 123** - Ready, low risk, enables PR 124
2. **PR 124** - Critical bug fix, depends on PR 123
3. **PR 125** - Independent refactor, can be merged anytime
4. **PR 126** - Blocked, needs conflict resolution

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: PR 123, PR 125
- **Medium Risk**: PR 124
- **High Risk**: PR 126

## Code Review Process

### Mandatory Code Review Steps
1. **Fetch Actual File Changes**: Use GitHub API/CLI to get detailed file diffs
2. **File-Level Analysis**: For each modified file, analyze:
   - Code patterns (architecture, design patterns, best practices)
   - Function signatures and logic flow changes
   - Variable naming conventions and code clarity
   - Error handling and edge case coverage
   - Performance implications (loops, queries, algorithms)
3. **Cross-PR Conflict Detection**: Build a file modification matrix to identify:
   - Files modified by multiple PRs (HIGH RISK - flag for manual review)
   - Function-level conflicts (same functions modified)
   - Dependency conflicts (imports, exports, API contracts)
4. **Code Quality Scoring**: Rate each PR on:
   - Implementation elegance (1-10)
   - Code maintainability (1-10)
   - Pattern consistency (1-10)
   - Test coverage quality (1-10)
5. **Business Value Assessment**: Evaluate:
   - User-facing impact clarity
   - Technical debt reduction
   - System reliability improvement
6. **Recommendation Engine**: Compare all 4 PRs and select the single best PR based on:
   - Highest code quality score
   - Lowest risk assessment
   - Maximum business value
   - Optimal dependency enablement
