# REPORT 1
Summary
The causal replay artifact for Phase 1 remains a placeholder and still indicates “Status: Pending generation,” so the promised P01→P23 simulation was never produced.

POP observer evidence is missing: the pop folder only contains the default activation checklist with null metrics, leaving all three observer cycles and activation proof undone.

Stage S1 Reasoning DNA schemas were never created—the expected .artifacts/reasoning-dna/ directory does not exist, so downstream upgrades lack their required overlays.

Issues
Causal replay simulation has not been generated for Phase 1.1.

1. Read `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/catalog/protocol_catalog.json` to enumerate P01–P23 gate boundaries and expected handoffs.
2. Synthesize mock ledger entries (timestamp, protocol, gate\_id, evidence pointers) for every boundary and validate the sequence against the documented handoffs.
3. Detect and note any missing events or cycle risks during the traversal.
4. Replace the placeholder content in `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/cross/causal_replay.md` with the full replay narrative and validation results.

**POP observer cycles and activation evidence are absent; the checklist still shows null metrics.**

1. Run the POP observer across three cycles (baseline, validation with PIK advisory, confirmation with full S0–S5 overlays) and collect metrics for each run.
2. Save the results to `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/pop/cycle-1-results.json`, `cycle-2-results.json`, and `cycle-3-results.json`, capturing cycle detection, gate skips, version drift, DNA coverage, PEL retries, and temporal health as specified.
3. Aggregate the confirmed metrics into `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/pop/activation-evidence.json` and update `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/pop/pop-activation-check.json` with the actual values and status.

**Stage S1 Reasoning DNA outputs are missing, blocking dependent upgrades.**

1. Create `.artifacts/reasoning-dna/` and produce a `reasoning_dna.json` (or equivalent schema file) for each protocol P01–P28, capturing gates, rationale, and evidence links.
2. Validate each schema against the protocol catalog to confirm ≥90 % coverage, documenting validation results.
3. Cross-link the generated schemas with dependent upgrades (PIK, PEL, POP, etc.) to confirm they can resolve the DNA references without touching protocol files.

# REPORT 2
Summary
The repository still lacks several mandatory meta-upgrade overlays and validation artifacts, preventing the staged deployment plan from advancing beyond analysis. Below are the key gaps that must be addressed to satisfy the documented rollout requirements.

Causal replay simulation is still a placeholder. The execution guide expects .artifacts/meta-upgrades/cross/causal_replay.md to contain mock ledger traversals, handoff validation, and cycle detection results, but the file still records “Status: Pending generation.”

 Use the protocol catalog in `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/catalog/protocol_catalog.json` to enumerate all gates.
2. Generate mock ledger events (timestamp, gate\_id, evidence refs) for each boundary and record them in `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/cross/causal_replay.md`.
3. Document detected cycles, missing events, and validation outcomes inline so the replay can be audited without running protocols.

POP observer cycle artifacts are missing. The observer mode checklist calls for cycle 1–3 results to be saved under .artifacts/meta-upgrades/pop/, yet that directory still only contains pop-activation-check.json, so no evidence exists for cycle metrics or activation readiness updates.

1. Execute or simulate the observer runs described in `validators-system/AGENTS.md` and write outputs to `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/pop/cycle-1-results.json`, `cycle-2-results.json`, and `cycle-3-results.json`.
2. Summarize cycle metrics (cycles detected, gate skips, DNA coverage, temporal health) in each file.
3. Update `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/pop/pop-activation-check.json` with aggregated evidence once the three cycle reports exist.

Causal Ledger foundation is absent. Stage S0 requires initializing .artifacts/causal-ledger/ledger.json and capturing ≥95 % of gate transitions, but the ledger directory does not exist, leaving the foundational upgrade unmet.

1. Create `.artifacts/causal-ledger/ledger.json` and seed it with an append-only structure ready for mock decision events.
2. Populate the ledger with representative gate-transition entries for P01–P28 that demonstrate ≥95 % coverage.
3. Document the initialization and validation steps (including coverage calculations) in a README within `.artifacts/causal-ledger/`.

UPG03 SLA token configuration overlay is missing. The adaptation checklist directs that .artifacts/meta-upgrades/UPG03/sla-token-config.json capture bounded retry budgets, yet the directory only has the generic intent/alignment/decision files with no SLA definition.

 Create `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/UPG03/sla-token-config.json` with the token budget, per-retry consumption, and reset rules described in the deployment guide.
2. Reference the Temporal layer enforcement (UPG08) fields so the relationship between retries and SLA ceilings is explicit.
3. Cross-link the config from `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/UPG03/decision.json` via an `evidence_refs` entry for traceability.

UPG05 observer-mode configuration overlay is missing. The same deployment instructions require .artifacts/meta-upgrades/UPG05/observer-config.json to document POP’s observer-only status and gating thresholds, but only high-level summary files are present.

1. Create `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/UPG05/observer-config.json` describing POP mode, disabled controller features, and activation criteria thresholds.
2. Include references to the POP cycle result artifacts and activation check file so reviewers can trace how the mode is enforced.
3. Update `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/UPG05/decision.json` to cite the new configuration file in its evidence list.
---------
# REPORT 3
Summary
The meta-upgrades overlays capture high-level objectives, but key validation artifacts like the causal replay remain flagged as “pending,” leaving no simulated ledger traversal to prove the cross-protocol flow.

POP activation tracking is still observer-only with all evidence fields unset, so there is no recorded proof that the gating criteria have been met.

Issues
The causal replay deliverable is still a stub that reports “Status: Pending,” so Phase 1 lacks the required P01→P23 traversal simulation and ledger event coverage.

1. Use `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/catalog/protocol_catalog.json` to enumerate every protocol handoff and gate boundary.
2. Synthesize mock ledger events for each transition and expand `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/cross/causal_replay.md` with structured sections (timestamps, gate IDs, evidence references, detected gaps).
3. Summarize missing events or cycle risks and cross-check the flow against `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/cross/upgrade_protocol_graph.json` before marking the simulation complete.

The POP observer evidence set is incomplete—cycle-1-results.json, cycle-2-results.json, and cycle-3-results.json are absent, leaving Phases 2.1–2.3 without documented metrics.

1. Execute the three planned observer runs and capture cycle detection, gate skips, version drift, DNA coverage, PEL retries, and temporal health metrics.
2. Store each run’s findings in `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/pop/cycle-1-results.json`, `cycle-2-results.json`, and `cycle-3-results.json`, referencing the Causal Ledger IDs where applicable.
3. Note any anomalies or false positives and ensure each report aligns with the acceptance targets before closing Phase 2.

POP activation gating lacks supporting evidence: the activation check file still has null metrics and there is no activation-evidence.json, so the Phase 5 decision gate cannot be audited.

1. Aggregate validated metrics from the completed observer cycles (DNA coverage, PIK pass rate, PEL runs, ledger coverage, temporal health).
2. Update `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/pop/pop-activation-check.json` with the measured values and resulting status, ensuring the rationale references ledger entries.
3. Create `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/pop/activation-evidence.json` that cites the supporting artifacts and explicitly states whether the controller promotion criteria are satisfied.
---------
# REPORT 4

Summary
The causal replay artifact remains a placeholder and lacks the required P01→P23 traversal evidence.

POP observer validation outputs (cycles 1–3) and activation evidence have not been recorded, leaving the activation checklist without data.

The Stage S1 Reasoning DNA schemas were never generated, so there is no coverage evidence for the protocols.

Findings
**causal_replay.md is still a placeholder and lacks the full causal replay simulation required for Phase 1 validation.**

1. Open `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/cross/causal_replay.md`.
2. For each protocol handoff (P01→P02→…→P23), document timestamped mock ledger entries, gate IDs, and evidence pointers referencing `catalog/protocol_catalog.json`.
3. Add verification notes confirming replay alignment with documented handoffs, highlighting any cycle risks or missing events.
4. Summarize findings and mark simulation status as complete.

**POP observer cycle result artifacts (cycle-1/2/3-results.json) are missing despite being mandatory for Stage S5 evidence.**

1. Execute observer-mode simulations (or documented mock runs) for cycles 1–3 as described in `validators-system/AGENTS.md`.
2. Capture metrics (cycle detection, gate skips, version drift, temporal health, etc.) and serialize them into `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/pop/cycle-1-results.json`, `cycle-2-results.json`, and `cycle-3-results.json`.
3. Ensure each JSON file includes mode, metrics, false-positive rate, and references to ledger entries.
4. Cross-link these files in supporting documentation or summaries as needed.

**pop-activation-check.json has null evidence fields, so activation readiness cannot be assessed.**

1. Aggregate metrics from the completed observer cycles and ledger/DNA coverage analyses.
2. Update `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/pop/pop-activation-check.json` `current_evidence` fields with numeric values (e.g., coverage percentages, counts, status strings).
3. Adjust the `status` field to reflect the evaluated state (e.g., `pending`, `ready`, or `blocked`) based on the activation criteria.
4. Add concise notes referencing the specific result files that substantiate each metric.

**Reasoning DNA schemas (.artifacts/reasoning-dna/*.json) were never generated, leaving Stage S1 acceptance criteria unmet.**

 For each protocol P01–P28, synthesize `reasoning_dna.json` content capturing prerequisites, reasoning paths, and decision points per the schema described in `validators-system/AGENTS.md`.
2. Validate each schema against Protocol Format v2.1.0 and ensure linkage to corresponding ledger events.
3. Save the artifacts to `.artifacts/reasoning-dna/` using a consistent naming convention (e.g., `P01-schema.json`).
4. Document coverage statistics and validation outcomes to prove ≥90% decision-point coverage.
