## Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Protocol Input Forms Creation (All 12)

- Protocol number, name, domain, purpose
- AI role and primary guardrail
- Prerequisites and phase placement
- Detailed execution phases with steps
- Evidence collection requirements
- Quality gates with criteria and failure handling
- Integration points (inputs/outputs)
- Automation hooks
- Communication protocols
- Completion checklist

**Files to Create**: 12 YAML forms in `/generators/` directory

### Phase 2: Protocol Generation (All 12)
Using `protocol-generator-instructions.md`, generate complete protocols:
- Follow exact structure from existing protocols
- Include all required sections (Role, Steps, Integration, Gates, Communication, Handoff)
- Use correct markers (`[MUST]`, `[GUIDELINE]`, `[CRITICAL]`, `[STRICT]`)
- Maintain heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Include practical examples and code snippets

**Files to Create**: 12 protocol markdown files in `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/`

### Phase 3: Generator Creation (All 12)

- Define template structure
- Specify quality acceptance criteria
- Document validation checklist

### Phase 4: Circular Validation (All 12)
For each protocol, execute circular validation:
1. Run Meta-Analysis Generator on generated protocol
2. Verify all 4 layers present in analysis
3. Check subsystem mapping accuracy
4. Validate cognitive role assignment
5. Regenerate if validation fails

**Validation Criteria**:
- Layer 1 (System-Level Decisions): Mission, role, governance ✓
- Layer 2 (Behavioral Control): Quality gates, validation checkpoints ✓
- Layer 3 (Procedural Logic): Step-by-step procedures, tool invocations ✓
- Layer 4 (Communication Grammar): Announcements, prompts, narrative ✓

### Phase 5: Workflow Integration & Documentation
1. Update `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/README.md` with new protocols
2. Update `generators/GENERATORS-INDEX.md` with new generators
3. Create complete workflow map (Markdown) showing all 28 protocols
4. Update protocol dependency diagram
5. Generate comprehensive quality gates table
6. Document automation hooks for new protocols

**Files to Update**:
- `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/README.md`
- `generators/GENERATORS-INDEX.md`
- `generators/GENERATOR-SYSTEM-SUMMARY.md`

### Phase 6: Validation & Testing
1. Execute comprehensive validation suite
2. Test protocol → generator → protocol circular validation
3. Validate workflow integration completeness
4. Test automation hooks for all protocols
5. Verify no gaps in complete SDLC coverage

**Validation Commands**:
```bash
python scripts/validate_protocols.py --all
python scripts/test_circular_validation.py --protocols 6-18
