## AI META WORKFLOW TEST PROTOCOL



- Test the entire AI-driven workflow system phase by phase until every component, gate, dependency, and artifact has been validated.  
- During testing, observe logic flow, data transitions, and internal consistency across all connected processes.  
- When an error, anomaly, or inconsistency appears:
  - Analyze and fix it immediately within this session.
  - After fixing, stop execution. Do not continue beyond the fix.
- For every finished phase (or after any fix):
  - Create a clear documentation record of everything done, including reasoning, validation steps, and results.
  - Generate a visual or structural diagram representing the tested phase.
  - Prepare a continuation prompt containing:  
    - What was tested and fixed,  
    - The verified outputs and artifacts,  
    - The next target phase or objective for the following session.
- Each session is a continuation of the last. The next session must read and understand the previous documentation, diagram, and continuation prompt before resuming.
- Repeat this until the entire workflow system has been logically and functionally verified.
