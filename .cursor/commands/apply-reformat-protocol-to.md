# COMMAND: REFORMAT PROTOCOL WITH CATEGORY-BASED FORMATS

**Usage:** Read this file and execute the reformat steps for the specified target protocol file.

**Target File Parameter:** When executing, specify which protocol file to reformat (e.g., `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/08-generate-tasks.md`)

## üìã Purpose

This command reformats existing protocol files to follow the **category-based format system** while **preserving ALL existing content** including reasoning, logic, steps, evidence requirements, gates, and automation hooks.

**Core Principle:** Change ONLY the structural format, never the content.

---

## üéØ Objective

Reformat the specified protocol file to follow category-based format standards while preserving ALL existing content (reasoning, logic, steps, evidence, gates).

---

## üì• Input Parameters

When executing this command, you need:

- **Target Protocol File:** Specify the protocol path (e.g., `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/08-generate-tasks.md`)
- **Preserve Content:** YES (mandatory - non-negotiable)
- **Apply Category Formats:** YES (mandatory)

**Example Execution:**
1. Read this file (`.cursor/commands/apply-reformat-protocol-to.md`)
2. Follow all steps below
3. Apply to target file: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/01-client-proposal-generation.md`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Execution Steps

### Output Directory (Single Folder)

All generated outputs must be placed under a single folder to avoid clutter.

- Root: `.artifacts/protocol-reformat/[protocol-stem]/`
- Files:
  - `ORIGINAL-BACKUP.md`
  - `CONTENT-INVENTORY.json`
  - `FORMAT-ANALYSIS.md`
  - `format-changes.diff`
  - `validation-report.md`
  - `REFORMATTED.md` (optional working file before overwrite)

Note: `[protocol-stem]` is the basename of the protocol file without extension (e.g., `01-client-proposal-generation`).

### STEP 1: Content Inventory & Backup

**[STRICT]** Before any changes, create a complete inventory of existing content:

1. **Read the entire protocol file**
2. **Extract and document:**
   - All reasoning blocks and their justifications
   - All logic flows and decision trees
   - All step sequences and substeps
   - All evidence requirements (`.artifacts/...` paths)
   - All gate definitions and validation criteria
   - All automation hooks and scripts
   - All handoff checklists
   - All integration points
   - All [STRICT], [MUST], [GUIDELINE] markers

3. **Create backup file:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .artifacts/protocol-reformat/[protocol-stem]
   cp [protocol-path] .artifacts/protocol-reformat/[protocol-stem]/ORIGINAL-BACKUP.md
   ```

4. **Generate content inventory:**
   Create `.artifacts/protocol-reformat/[protocol-stem]/CONTENT-INVENTORY.json` containing:
   ```json
   {
     "reasoning_blocks_count": 12,
     "evidence_requirements_count": 15,
     "script_references": ["scripts/validate_xyz.py", ...],
     "artifact_paths": [".artifacts/proposal/...", ...],
     "gate_definitions_count": 4,
     "automation_hooks_count": 8
   }
   ```

---

### STEP 2: Section Analysis

**[STRICT]** For EACH section in the protocol, perform this analysis:

#### 2.1 Identify Section Type

Ask for each section: **"What is this section DOING?"**

| Section Behavior | Category File | Variant (if applicable) |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Executing simple workflow | EXECUTION-FORMATS.md | BASIC |
| Executing detailed tracking (5+ substeps) | EXECUTION-FORMATS.md | SUBSTEPS |
| Executing with critical decisions | EXECUTION-FORMATS.md | REASONING |
| Setting rules/standards | GUIDELINES-FORMATS.md | N/A |
| Creating project issues | ISSUE-FORMATS.md | N/A |
| Multi-agent orchestration | PROMPT-FORMATS.md | N/A |
| Protocol analysis/generation | META-FORMATS.md | N/A |

#### 2.2 Document Format Choice

For each section, add an HTML comment at the beginning:

```markdown
<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-FORMATS - REASONING variant] -->
<!-- Why: This phase involves critical go/no-go decisions requiring documented premises, alternatives, and risk assessment -->
```

**Example Section Analysis:**

```markdown
## WORKFLOW

<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-FORMATS - Mixed variants by phase] -->

### PHASE 1: Context Preparation
<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Simple file loading and validation, no complex decisions -->

### PHASE 2: Stakeholder Alignment
<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-REASONING] -->
<!-- Why: Critical decision on proposal scope requires documented alternatives and risk assessment -->

### PHASE 3: Detailed Breakdown
<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-SUBSTEPS] -->
<!-- Why: Multiple precise substeps (7+ steps) requiring exact tracking and evidence collection -->

### PHASE 4: Validation
<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->
<!-- Why: Straightforward validation checklist -->
```

---

### STEP 3: Format Application

**[STRICT]** Apply the selected format to each section following these rules:

#### Rule 1: Preserve ALL Content Elements

**‚úÖ MUST KEEP:**
- Every reasoning block
- Every logic explanation
- Every step description
- Every evidence requirement (exact path: `.artifacts/...`)
- Every validation criterion
- Every script reference (exact name and path)
- Every gate definition
- Every handoff item
- Every [STRICT], [MUST], [GUIDELINE] marker
- Every example (DO/DON'T blocks)

#### Rule 2: Change ONLY Structure

**‚ùå DO NOT:**
- Remove or summarize content
- Change script names or paths
- Modify evidence artifact paths
- Remove reasoning justifications
- Simplify decision documentation
- Merge steps to reduce length
- Remove "redundant" validation checks

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Change header levels (e.g., `###` to `####`)
- Change numbering style (e.g., `1.` to `1.1`)
- Add `[REASONING]` blocks where decisions exist
- Restructure subsections for clarity
- Add format choice comments
- Improve visual hierarchy

#### Rule 3: Format-Specific Transformations

**If applying EXECUTION-BASIC:**

```markdown
## PHASE [N]: [Phase Name]

1. **`[MUST]` [Step Name]:**
   * **Action:** [What to do - preserve exact original wording]
   * **Evidence:** [Required output - preserve exact artifact path]

   **Example (DO):**
   [If original has example, preserve it exactly]
   
   **Example (DON'T):**
   [If original has anti-pattern, preserve it exactly]
```

**If applying EXECUTION-SUBSTEPS:**

```markdown
## PHASE [N]: [Phase Name]

   * **[N].3. [Substep Name]:**
       * **Action:** [What to do]
       * **Evidence:** [Required output]
```

**If applying EXECUTION-REASONING:**

```markdown
## PHASE [N]: [Phase Name]

1. **`[MUST]` [Step Name]:**
   * **Action:** [What to do - preserve exact original wording]
   
   **[REASONING]:**
   - **Premises:** [Starting facts/conditions - extract from original context]
   - **Constraints:** [Limitations/requirements - extract from original]
   - **Alternatives Considered:**
     * **A)** [Option 1] - [Why selected/rejected - from original logic]
     * **B)** [Option 2] - [Why selected/rejected - from original logic]
     * **C)** [Option 3] - [If exists in original]
   - **Decision:** [Final choice and justification - from original]
   - **Evidence:** [Supporting data/references for decision]
   - **Risks & Mitigations:**
     * **Risk:** [Potential issue] ‚Üí **Mitigation:** [How to address]
     * [Additional risks from original]
   - **Acceptance Link:** [Reference to requirement/standard/PRD section]
   
   * **Evidence:** [Required output - preserve exact artifact path]
   * **Validation:** [How to verify - preserve exact criteria]
   
   **Example (DO):**
   [If original has example, preserve it exactly]
```

REF=[protocol-path]

grep -c "\[REASONING\]" "$ORIG"; grep -c "\[REASONING\]" "$REF"  # Must match
grep -c "\.artifacts/" "$ORIG"; grep -c "\.artifacts/" "$REF"      # Must match
grep -c "scripts/" "$ORIG"; grep -c "scripts/" "$REF"                # Must match
```

---

### STEP 5: Diff Comparison

**[STRICT]** Generate a comprehensive diff report:

```bash
# 1. Compare structure changes only (ignore whitespace)
diff -u .artifacts/protocol-reformat/[protocol-stem]/ORIGINAL-BACKUP.md \
       [protocol-path] > .artifacts/protocol-reformat/[protocol-stem]/format-changes.diff

# 2. Verify no content loss - Reasoning blocks
echo "Original reasoning blocks:"
grep -c "REASONING" .artifacts/protocol-reformat/[protocol-stem]/ORIGINAL-BACKUP.md
echo "Reformatted reasoning blocks:"
grep -c "REASONING" [protocol-path]

# 3. Verify no content loss - Evidence paths
echo "Original evidence paths:"
grep -c ".artifacts/" .artifacts/protocol-reformat/[protocol-stem]/ORIGINAL-BACKUP.md
echo "Reformatted evidence paths:"
grep -c ".artifacts/" [protocol-path]

# 4. Verify no content loss - Script references
echo "Original script references:"
grep -c "scripts/" .artifacts/protocol-reformat/[protocol-stem]/ORIGINAL-BACKUP.md
echo "Reformatted script references:"
grep -c "scripts/" [protocol-path]

# 5. Verify no content loss - Gates
echo "Original gates:"
grep -c "Gate [0-9]:" .artifacts/protocol-reformat/[protocol-stem]/ORIGINAL-BACKUP.md
echo "Reformatted gates:"
grep -c "Gate [0-9]:" [protocol-path]
```

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

**The reformat is successful if:**

‚úÖ All content from original protocol is present in reformatted version  
‚úÖ Format follows category-based selection principles  
‚úÖ Each section uses the most appropriate format variant  
‚úÖ Format choices are documented and justified  
‚úÖ No script paths or artifact paths were modified  
‚úÖ All reasoning logic is preserved  
‚úÖ Protocol remains fully executable  
‚úÖ Validation report shows 100% content preservation  
‚úÖ Diff shows ONLY structural/formatting changes

---

## ‚ùå Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**DO NOT:**

‚ùå Choose one format for entire protocol without section-by-section analysis  
‚ùå Remove "verbose" reasoning blocks to "clean up" the document  
‚ùå Change evidence artifact paths "for consistency"  
‚ùå Simplify complex REASONING blocks to BASIC format to reduce length  
‚ùå Apply SUBSTEPS format when simple BASIC would suffice (over-engineering)  
‚ùå Miss the "Why" justification comments for format choices  
‚ùå Merge multiple steps into one to make protocol "shorter"  
‚ùå Remove examples or DO/DON'T blocks as "redundant"  
‚ùå Change script names to "standardize" them  
‚ùå Simplify validation criteria to "streamline" the process

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Content appears to be lost after reformat

**Solution:**
1. Compare content inventory JSON before/after
2. Run validation report script
3. If mismatch found, restore from backup and re-analyze section format choices
4. Ensure REASONING variant was used for decision-heavy sections

### Issue: Diff shows unexpected content changes

**Solution:**
1. Review diff line by line
2. Identify if changes are:
   - Structural only (acceptable) - e.g., header level changes
   - Content modifications (unacceptable) - restore from backup
3. Re-run with stricter content preservation rules

### Issue: Format choice seems wrong for a section

**Solution:**
1. Re-read the section's actual behavior
2. Ask: "What is this section DOING?" (not "What is it about?")
3. Check if section involves:
   - Simple workflow? ‚Üí BASIC
   - Detailed tracking? ‚Üí SUBSTEPS
   - Critical decisions? ‚Üí REASONING
4. Update format choice and document why

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Identify protocol to reformat**
2. **Invoke command:**
   ```markdown
   @apply .cursor/commands/apply-reformat-protocol-to.md --file=[your-protocol-path]
   ```
3. **Review validation report**
4. **Verify diff shows only structural changes**
5. **Confirm protocol is still executable**
6. **Archive backup and deliverables**

---

## üìù Notes

- **Backup First:** Always creates backup before any changes
- **Content Sacred:** Content preservation is non-negotiable
- **Format Flexible:** Format choices are per-section, not per-protocol
- **Document Choices:** Every format choice must have a "Why" comment
- **Validate Everything:** Multiple validation layers ensure no content loss
