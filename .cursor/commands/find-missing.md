## Missing Transitions

### 1. Integration Testing to Quality Audit (P11 → P12)
**Gap Type**: Missing transition / Broken handoff  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 11 → Protocol 12  
**Severity**: **CRITICAL**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/11-integration-testing.md:385-386`, `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/12-quality-audit.md:13-17`  
**Description**: Protocol 11 handoff states "Ready for Protocol 19: Quality Audit" but the actual next protocol should be 12 (Quality Audit is Protocol 12, not 19). This is a critical documentation error. Additionally, Protocol 12 prerequisites reference Protocol 15 and 21 (future protocols in the workflow), creating a temporal impossibility where quality audit cannot execute because it depends on deployment artifacts that don't yet exist.  
**Suggested Fix**: 
1. Correct Protocol 11 handoff target from "Protocol 19" to "Protocol 12"
2. Remove circular dependencies from Protocol 12 prerequisites (remove Protocol 15, 21 references)
3. Define clear integration → quality audit artifact handoff

### 2. Task Processing to Integration Testing (P10 → P11)
**Gap Type**: Missing transition / Incorrect handoff target  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 10 → Protocol 11  
**Severity**: **HIGH**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/10-process-tasks.md:381-382`  
**Description**: Protocol 10 handoff states "Ready for Protocol 15: Integration Testing & System Validation" but Protocol 15 is actually "Production Deployment". The correct target should be Protocol 11 (Integration Testing). This represents a critical workflow sequence error.  
**Suggested Fix**: Correct Protocol 10 handoff from "Protocol 15" to "Protocol 11"

### 3. Deployment to Monitoring (P15 → P16)
**Gap Type**: Incorrect handoff target  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 15 → Protocol 16  
**Severity**: **HIGH**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/15-production-deployment.md:417-418`  
**Description**: Protocol 15 handoff states "Ready for Protocol 19: Monitoring & Observability" but Protocol 19 is actually "Documentation & Knowledge Transfer". The correct target should be Protocol 16 (Monitoring/Observability). This breaks the post-deployment workflow.  
**Suggested Fix**: Correct Protocol 15 handoff from "Protocol 19" to "Protocol 16"

### 4. Monitoring to Incident Response (P16 → P17/P20)
**Gap Type**: Incorrect/unclear handoff target  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 16 → Protocol 17/20  
**Severity**: **MEDIUM**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/16-monitoring-observability.md:412-413`  
**Description**: Protocol 16 handoff states "Ready for Protocol 20: Incident Response & Rollback" but Protocol 20 is actually "Project Closure". The correct target should be Protocol 17 (Incident Response). This creates ambiguity in operational workflow.  
**Suggested Fix**: Correct Protocol 16 handoff from "Protocol 20" to "Protocol 17" for incident response path

### 5. PRD Creation Self-Reference (P06 → P06)
**Gap Type**: Circular/invalid handoff  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 06 → Protocol 06  
**Severity**: **MEDIUM**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/06-create-prd.md:388-389`  
**Description**: Protocol 06 handoff states "Ready for Protocol 06: Technical Design & Architecture" which should be Protocol 07. This is a copy-paste error creating a self-referencing loop.  
**Suggested Fix**: Correct Protocol 06 handoff from "Protocol 06" to "Protocol 07"

### 6. Environment Setup to Task Execution (P09 → P10)
**Gap Type**: Incorrect handoff target  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 09 → Protocol 10  
**Severity**: **MEDIUM**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/09-environment-setup-validation.md:377-378`  
**Description**: Protocol 09 handoff states "Ready for Protocol 21: Controlled Task Execution" but Protocol 21 is "Maintenance Support". The correct target should be Protocol 10 (Process Tasks).  
**Suggested Fix**: Correct Protocol 09 handoff from "Protocol 21" to "Protocol 10"

### 7. Quality Audit to UAT (P12 → P13)
**Gap Type**: Incorrect handoff target  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 12 → Protocol 13  
**Severity**: **MEDIUM**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/12-quality-audit.md:411-412`  
**Description**: Protocol 12 handoff states "Ready for Protocol 20: User Acceptance Testing Coordination" but Protocol 20 is "Project Closure". The correct target should be Protocol 13 (UAT Coordination).  
**Suggested Fix**: Correct Protocol 12 handoff from "Protocol 20" to "Protocol 13"

### 8. UAT to Pre-Deployment (P13 → P14)
**Gap Type**: Incorrect handoff target (partially correct)  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 13 → Protocol 14/15  
**Severity**: **LOW**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/13-uat-coordination.md:416-417`  
**Description**: Protocol 13 handoff states "Ready for Protocol 21: Pre-Deployment Validation & Staging Readiness and Protocol 15: Production Deployment" but Protocol 21 is "Maintenance Support". Should target Protocol 14 (Pre-Deployment Staging) then Protocol 15.  
**Suggested Fix**: Correct Protocol 13 handoff to reference "Protocol 14" instead of "Protocol 21"

### 9. Incident Response Multi-Target (P17 → P21/P22)
**Gap Type**: Incorrect handoff targets  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 17 → multiple  
**Severity**: **MEDIUM**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/17-incident-response-rollback.md:418-419`  
**Description**: Protocol 17 handoff states "Ready for Protocol 21: Performance Optimization & Tuning and Protocol 22: Implementation Retrospective" but Protocol 21 is "Maintenance Support" and the performance optimization is Protocol 18.  
**Suggested Fix**: Correct Protocol 17 handoff to reference "Protocol 18" (Performance Optimization) instead of "Protocol 21"

### 10. Bootstrap to Discovery Alternate (P05 → P24)
**Gap Type**: Unclear workflow branch  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 05 → Protocol 24  
**Severity**: **LOW**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/05-bootstrap-your-project.md:441-442`  
**Description**: Protocol 05 handoff states "Ready for Protocol 04-CD: Client Discovery (Alternate)" which maps to Protocol 24. This alternate track is unclear—when should developers use Protocol 24 vs the mainline workflow?  
**Suggested Fix**: Document branching criteria for when to use Protocol 24 (alternate discovery) vs continuing mainline workflow

## Circular Dependencies (Temporal Impossibilities)

### 1. Protocol 11 → Protocol 19/21 (Integration Testing → Future Protocols)
**Gap Type**: Circular dependency / Forward reference  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 11  
**Severity**: **CRITICAL**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/11-integration-testing.md:13-17`  
**Description**: Protocol 11 prerequisites reference "Protocol 21 (if previously generated)" and "Protocol 19" artifacts, but these protocols execute much later (Phase 6: Closure). Integration testing (Phase 3) cannot depend on maintenance and documentation artifacts that don't exist yet.  
**Suggested Fix**: Remove Protocol 19 and 21 from Protocol 11 prerequisites. Integration testing should only depend on Protocols 07 and 09.

### 2. Protocol 12 → Protocol 15/21/23 (Quality Audit → Future Protocols)
**Gap Type**: Circular dependency / Forward reference  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 12  
**Severity**: **CRITICAL**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/12-quality-audit.md:14-17`  
**Description**: Protocol 12 prerequisites reference Protocol 15 (Production Deployment), Protocol 21 (Maintenance), and Protocol 23 (Script Governance)—all future protocols. Quality audit (Phase 4) cannot depend on deployment and maintenance artifacts.  
**Suggested Fix**: Remove Protocol 15, 21, 23 from Protocol 12 prerequisites. Quality audit should depend on Protocol 11 (Integration Testing) outputs.

### 3. Protocol 13 → Protocol 19/15/21 (UAT → Future Protocols)
**Gap Type**: Circular dependency / Forward reference  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 13  
**Severity**: **CRITICAL**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/13-uat-coordination.md:14-17`  
**Description**: Protocol 13 prerequisites reference Protocol 19 (Documentation), Protocol 15 (Deployment), and Protocol 21 (Maintenance)—protocols that execute later in the lifecycle.  
**Suggested Fix**: Remove Protocol 19, 15, 21 from Protocol 13 prerequisites. UAT should depend on Protocol 12 (Quality Audit) outputs.

### 4. Protocol 14 → Protocol 19/15/21 (Pre-Deployment → Future Protocols)
**Gap Type**: Circular dependency / Forward reference  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 14  
**Severity**: **CRITICAL**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/14-pre-deployment-staging.md:14-17`  
**Description**: Protocol 14 prerequisites reference Protocol 19, 15 (circular: pre-deployment cannot depend on deployment), and 21.  
**Suggested Fix**: Remove Protocol 19, 15, 21 from Protocol 14 prerequisites. Pre-deployment should depend on Protocol 13 (UAT) outputs.

### 5. Protocol 15 → Protocol 21 (Deployment → Maintenance)
**Gap Type**: Circular dependency  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 15  
**Severity**: **HIGH**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/15-production-deployment.md:14-17`  
**Description**: Protocol 15 prerequisites reference Protocol 21 "PRE-DEPLOYMENT-PACKAGE.zip" but Protocol 21 is Maintenance Support which comes after deployment.  
**Suggested Fix**: Remove Protocol 21 from Protocol 15 prerequisites. Deployment should depend on Protocol 14 (Pre-Deployment Staging).

### 6. Protocol 17/18 → Protocol 19 (Operations → Documentation)
**Gap Type**: Circular dependency  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 17, 18  
**Severity**: **MEDIUM**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/17-incident-response-rollback.md:14-17`, `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/18-performance-optimization.md:14-16`  
**Description**: Protocols 17 and 18 prerequisites reference Protocol 19 "MONITORING-PACKAGE.zip" but Protocol 19 is in Phase 6 (Closure) while Protocols 17/18 are Phase 5 (Operations).  
**Suggested Fix**: Remove Protocol 19 from Protocols 17 and 18 prerequisites. These should depend on Protocol 16 (Monitoring) outputs.

### 7. Protocol 19 → Protocol 21 (Documentation → Maintenance)
**Gap Type**: Circular dependency  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 19  
**Severity**: **MEDIUM**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/19-documentation-knowledge-transfer.md:17`  
**Description**: Protocol 19 prerequisites reference Protocol 21 "SPRINT-IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES.md" creating a circular dependency where documentation depends on maintenance which depends on documentation.  
**Suggested Fix**: Remove Protocol 21 from Protocol 19 prerequisites. Documentation should gather implementation notes from development phase (Protocols 10-11), not from future maintenance.

## Duplicate Coverage

### 1. Discovery Overlap (P02 vs P24)
**Gap Type**: Duplicate coverage / Unclear branching  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 02, Protocol 24  
**Severity**: **MEDIUM**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/02-client-discovery-initiation.md:1-10`, `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/24-client-discovery-ALTERNATE-TRACK.md:1-10`  
**Description**: Both Protocol 02 (Client Discovery Initiation) and Protocol 24 (Client Discovery Alternate Track) perform client discovery with similar artifacts and objectives. No clear documentation exists explaining when to use each path or if they should be consolidated.  
**Suggested Fix**: 
1. Document explicit branching criteria (e.g., use P24 for iterative/agile projects, P02 for waterfall)
2. Or consolidate into single protocol with configuration options
3. Exclude P24 from mainline workflow (already marked as "Alternate Track")

## Undefined Inputs

### 1. Protocol 06 Multiple Prerequisites (P03, P04, P05)
**Gap Type**: Complex dependency web  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 06  
**Severity**: **MEDIUM**  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/06-create-prd.md:14-16`  
**Description**: Protocol 06 requires artifacts from Protocols 03 (PROJECT-BRIEF.md), 04 (discovery-brief.md, evidence-map.json), and 05 (architecture-principles.md). However, the workflow shows P03 → P04 → P05 → P06, meaning P06 transitively depends on all three. The prerequisite list appears redundant rather than undefined.  
**Suggested Fix**: Clarify that Protocol 06 only directly depends on Protocol 05 outputs, which transitively include P03 and P04 artifacts. Simplify prerequisite documentation.

### 2. Protocol 07 Circular Reference (P03, P06, P04)
**Gap Type**: Potential circular dependency  
**Involved Protocols**: Protocol 07  
**Severity**: **LOW** (likely documentation error)  
**Evidence**: `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/07-technical-design-architecture.md:14-16`  
**Description**: Protocol 07 prerequisites list Protocol 03, 06, 04 but the correct sequence should be P06 → P07. The P03 and P04 references may be documentation artifacts.  
**Suggested Fix**: Simplify Protocol 07 prerequisites to only reference Protocol 06 (which transitively includes P03, P04, P05).

### 3. Standard Workflow Missing Coverage
**Gap Type**: Missing SDLC phases  
**Involved Protocols**: Overall workflow  
**Severity**: **LOW**  
**Evidence**: Task requirements specify standard workflow: "Client Discovery → Requirements → Architecture Design → Environment Setup → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Monitoring → Maintenance → Closure"  
**Description**: The 23-protocol workflow covers the standard SDLC phases but uses non-standard naming:
- ✅ Client Discovery: P01-P02 
- ✅ Requirements: P03, P06
- ✅ Architecture Design: P07
- ✅ Environment Setup: P09
- ✅ Implementation: P10
- ✅ Testing: P11-P14
- ✅ Deployment: P15
- ✅ Monitoring: P16
- ✅ Maintenance: P21
- ✅ Closure: P20, P22

**Additional protocols** not in standard workflow:
- P04-P05: Project bootstrap (Foundation phase)
- P08: Task generation (Planning helper)
- P17-P18: Incident response & performance (Operational)
- P19: Documentation (Knowledge management)
- P23: Script governance (Automation)

**Suggested Fix**: No action needed—the workflow has complete SDLC coverage with additional supporting protocols. Consider documenting the mapping between standard SDLC and protocol numbering.

## Validation Notes

### Evidence Standards
- ✅ All evidence citations reference exact file paths and line ranges from `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/` directory
- ✅ All gaps verified against actual protocol file content (no assumptions)
- ✅ `UNVERIFIED` tags used only when documentation is genuinely unclear or contradictory
- ✅ No fabricated protocols, dependencies, or artifacts appear in this analysis
- ✅ Protocols 00, 24-27 excluded from mainline validation per task scope (00=supporting, 24-27=documentation/alternate tracks)

### Methodology
- **Source**: Direct file analysis of 23 mainline protocols (01-23)
- **Coverage**: 100% of protocols analyzed for prerequisites, handoffs, and dependencies
- **Verification**: Each gap cross-referenced against actual file content
- **Scope**: Focused on protocol sequencing, dependency correctness, and SDLC coverage

### Key Findings Summary
1. **Handoff Target Errors**: 10 protocols have incorrect "next protocol" references (e.g., P10→P15 should be P10→P11)
2. **Circular Dependencies**: 7 instances of protocols referencing future protocols in prerequisites (temporal impossibilities)
3. **Phase 4 Critical Issues**: Quality/Testing phase (P11-P14) has the most severe issues with circular dependencies
4. **SDLC Coverage**: ✅ Complete coverage of standard workflow phases with additional supporting protocols
5. **Discovery Duplication**: P02 and P24 overlap without clear branching criteria

### Recommended Priority Actions
1. **Immediate** (Critical): Fix circular dependencies in Protocols 11-15 (remove forward references)
2. **High Priority**: Correct all 10 handoff target errors to restore workflow sequence integrity  
3. **Medium Priority**: Clarify Protocol 24 branching criteria or consolidate with Protocol 02
4. **Low Priority**: Simplify transitive dependency documentation in Protocols 06-07
