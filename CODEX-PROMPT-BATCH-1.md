- Protocol 2: Add prerequisites consuming Protocol 6 design outputs
- Protocol 2: Remove unrealistic web-search requirement
- All: Add quality gates with measurable criteria

### Phase 3: Environment & Execution Protocols (3 protocols)
**Order**: 7 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 9

**Focus**: Establish execution evidence pipeline.

**Key Fixes**:
- Protocol 7: Add prerequisites referencing Protocol 2 task files
- Protocol 3: Add integration section with explicit outputs to Protocol 9
- Protocol 3: Add quality gates for task completion
