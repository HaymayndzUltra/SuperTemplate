## Protocol Analysis

### Protocol 16: Documentation & Knowledge Transfer

| | **REPORT 1** | **REPORT 2** | **REPORT 3** | **REPORT 4** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PROBLEMS** | No critical problems. | Prerequisites for accepting sign-off artifacts "not explicitly listed." | Prerequisites need to confirm availability of deployment artifacts, retrospectives, and performance reports. | Missing "explicit prerequisites" makes it hard to ensure upstream protocols complete. |
| **SUGGESTIONS** | Add prerequisites (completed deployment report, performance findings). | Add "prerequisites checklist" referencing PRD updates, architecture packages, deployment logs, and UAT outputs. | Add prerequisites referencing final code repositories, monitoring evidence, and incident reports. | Add "prerequisite checklist" referencing UAT sign-off, deployment completion, and incident outcomes. |
| **OVERALL SCORE** | **8.17 / 10** | **8.83 / 10** | **7.83 / 10** | **6.67 / 10** |

### Protocol 17: Project Closure & Handover

| | **REPORT 1** | **REPORT 2** | **REPORT 3** | **REPORT 4** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PROBLEMS** | No critical problems. | Prerequisites to verify deliverable completion "not called out explicitly." | Prerequisites for accepting finalized documentation, sign-offs, and maintenance plans "missing." | "Missing prerequisite list" makes coordination with documentation and maintenance planning difficult. |
| **SUGGESTIONS** | Add prerequisites capturing required documentation and sign-offs. | Add "prerequisites checklist" covering documentation packages, deployment reports, and acceptance evidence. | Add prerequisites ensuring documentation completion, acceptance criteria, and support agreements. | Add "prerequisite checklist" referencing approved documentation packages and performance reports. |
| **OVERALL SCORE** | **8.17 / 10** | **8.83 / 10** | **7.83 / 10** | **6.67 / 10** |

### Protocol 18: Continuous Maintenance & Support Planning

| | **REPORT 1** | **REPORT 2** | **REPORT 3** | **REPORT 4** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PROBLEMS** | No critical problems. | Prerequisites confirming closure artifacts and operational ownership approvals "not explicit." | Prerequisites for accepted closure deliverables and support agreements "not stated." | "Missing prerequisites" reduces confidence that closure outputs are available before starting maintenance planning. |
| **SUGGESTIONS** | Add prerequisites referencing closure outputs and support charters. | Add "prerequisites checklist" covering closure approvals, documentation packages, and monitoring baselines. | Add prerequisites referencing closure approvals, documentation packages, and SLA baselines. | Add "prerequisite checklist" requiring closure manifest, documentation indexes, and performance insights. |
| **OVERALL SCORE** | **8.17 / 10** | **8.83 / 10** | **7.83 / 10** | **6.67 / 10** |

### Protocol 5: Implementation Retrospective

| | **REPORT 1** | **REPORT 2** | **REPORT 3** | **REPORT 4** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PROBLEMS** | **Missing integration points, quality gates, communication scripts, and handoff checklist.** | Missing "integration mapping." Missing prerequisites. No defined handoff outputs. | Missing "Integration, Quality Gate, or Handoff sections." Prerequisites are "implied." | Missing integration guidance. Missing quality gates. |
| **SUGGESTIONS** | Define inputs and outputs. Formalize quality gates. Add handoff checklist. | Add "Integration Points." Create prerequisites. Add "handoff checklist." | Add "integration points." Define quality gates. | Add "integration section." Define quality gates. |
| **OVERALL SCORE** | **4.50 / 10** | **5.17 / 10** | **5.17 / 10** | **5.33 / 10** |

### Review Protocols (Architecture, Code, Security)

| | **REPORT 1** | **REPORT 2** | **REPORT 3** | **REPORT 4** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PROBLEMS** | *Not covered in Report 1.* | *Not covered in Report 2.* | **(ID: arch-review, code-review, security-review)** **Missing all standard sections** (role, workflow, integration, quality gates, etc.). No evidence requirements. | *Not covered in Report 4.* |
| **SUGGESTIONS** | *Not covered in Report 1.* | *Not covered in Report 2.* | **Rebuild** documents using standard protocol template. Define "mandatory evidence artifacts." | *Not covered in Report 4.* |
| **OVERALL SCORE** | *Not covered in Report 1.* | *Not covered in Report 2.* | **3.67 - 3.83 / 10** | *Not covered in Report 4.* |

## Execution Order
Execute protocols in this exact sequence following CODEX prompt phase dependencies:
1. 16 → 17 → 18 → 5 (Phase 6)
2. architecture-review → code-review → security-check (Phase 7)

## Success Criteria
- Complete structural rewrite for Protocol 5
- Complete structural rewrite for all Review Protocols
- Prerequisites sections added to Protocols 16, 17, 18
- Integration points properly mapped
- Quality gates with measurable criteria
- Evidence requirements defined for all protocols
