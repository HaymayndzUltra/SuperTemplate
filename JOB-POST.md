We are seeking an experienced Fullstack Engineer to enhance and finalize the Interview Copilot module of our SaaS platform.
The module performs live transcription but requires improvements to reduce latency, save interview recordings and transcripts, enable playback, and generate detailed interview reports.
You’ll also be responsible for fixing existing bugs to ensure a stable, production-ready release.

Responsibilities
Optimize real-time transcription latency for speed and accuracy.
Implement secure recording and transcription storage with retrieval functionality.
Add interview playback directly within the user interface.
Build a report generation feature that summarizes interview data (timestamps, transcript text, insights).
Debug and resolve backend and frontend issues affecting system stability.
Manage development through GitLab repositories and CI/CD pipelines.
Collaborate with QA to validate functionality and ensure smooth deployment.

Requirements
5+ years of experience as a Fullstack Engineer (MERN stack preferred).
Strong background in AI transcription systems (Whisper, Deepgram, AssemblyAI, or similar).
Proficient in React.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
Hands-on experience with real-time audio streaming, data storage, and playback architecture.
Familiar with GitLab pipelines, staging environments, and production releases.
Excellent debugging, problem-solving, and performance optimization skills.
Ability to work independently and deliver production-ready solutions under deadlines.

Deliverables
Improved transcription latency and accuracy.
Working recording, playback, and report generation modules.
Fully integrated and tested build in GitLab staging and production.
Verified bug fixes and quality assurance sign-off.

***Loom video (required) demonstrating the working implementation.

***A Loom video (required) demonstrating a previous AI Interview Copilot or similar project you have built — showing real-time transcription, recording, or playback functionality.


Deliverables
* Optimized real-time transcription with reduced latency
* Secure recording and playback functionality
* Automated interview report generation
* All bugs and performance issues resolved
* Working build deployed via GitLab
