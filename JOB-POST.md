Summary
FinBoost is a gamified financial-education platform where users complete lessons to earn “Tickets” that enter them into tiered prize pools.

The MVP is fully functional and hosted on Replit (React + TypeScript frontend, Express + PostgreSQL backend via Drizzle ORM).

We recently completed a full security cleanup and are preparing for a limited beta launch.

I’m looking for an experienced full-stack developer or small dev shop to complete a focused pre-launch audit and hardening.
This includes reviewing code quality, migrating the database to a managed Postgres host (Supabase/Neon/Railway), improving test coverage, performing QA/user testing, and ensuring the system is production-ready.

What You’ll Do (SEE ATTACHED FOR FURTHER DETAIL)

Review the full stack (React/TypeScript + Express/Drizzle/Postgres).

Migrate the database from Replit to a managed provider (staging + prod setup).

Run and extend existing tests (≈5k lines already).

Perform functional QA and cross-device user-flow testing.

Fix priority bugs and address any P0/P1 issues.

Add error tracking (Sentry), monitoring, and rate-limiting.

Deliver a short Go/No-Go readiness report and update the README for easy hand-off.

Ideal Candidate

Strong with TypeScript, React, Node/Express, PostgreSQL, and testing frameworks (Jest, Supertest, Playwright/Cypress).

Experienced with DB migrations, security hardening, and QA automation.

Proactive communicator who can deliver clear documentation and milestone updates.
