Hey Everyone!! My name is Nik, I am a tenured multi brand business owner and I looking to hire a senior fullstack developer to create a Double Sided Market Place SaaS.  

I am specifically looking for a hyper honest/transparent senior engineer who fully understands the capability of Claude AI coding and is comfortable with their work being fact checked daily by another senior engineer (Friend of mine who owns an agency but doesn't have the bandwidth to take on the project)

I need to build an MVP as quickly as possible (1-2 weeks maximum)
I am okay with sacrificing quality/perfectness to achieve my timeline but the app must be functional for at least 1000 users

Daily standups and external code reviews are a must.
I can either provide wireframes or you can do this yourself using AI (We are drawing 99% inspiration from a similar app in the market)

If you believe you have the experience with claude or other co pilot code tools to achieve this timeline I am willing to pay a very generous hourly wage.  

Fluent English is an absolute must.

I am looking to make my hire by end of day Wednesday

If you are up for it lets jump on a video call and discuss the details!
Nik
