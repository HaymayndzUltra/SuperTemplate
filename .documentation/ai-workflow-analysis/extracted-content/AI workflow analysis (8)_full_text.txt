Demo Protocol Selection
This document details the selection of protocols for live demonstrations, describes the narrative scenario to
showcase them, and outlines interactive elements and metrics to engage viewers.
Recommended Protocols for Live Demos
The following protocols are chosen for their high impact, clear visual outputs, and ability to illustrate the
advantages of AI‑driven workflows in a live setting:
1. Protocol 01 – Client Proposal Generation: Demonstrates immediate value by transforming a raw
job post into a polished proposal. Viewers witness tone mapping, pricing analysis and risk flags
being generated 1 .
2. Protocol 03 – Project Brief Creation: Converts discovery outputs into a comprehensive brief. It
illustrates how the AI synthesizes requirements into user stories and acceptance criteria 2 .
3. Protocol 08 – Generate Tasks: Shows the automatic decomposition of a project brief into a
complete task backlog with priorities and an automation matrix 3 .
4. Protocol 12 – Quality Audit: Visualizes how lint, unit test and security results are unified into a
single report and readiness recommendation 4 .
5. Protocol 16 – Monitoring & Observability: Displays real‑time dashboards and alert rules,
highlighting proactive health checks 5 .
6. Protocol 18 – Performance Optimization: Illustrates how performance bottlenecks are detected
and remediated with measurable improvements 6 .
7. Protocol 19 – Documentation & Knowledge Transfer: Ends the demo by showing the
comprehensive documentation package and how knowledge is handed off to clients 7 .
These seven protocols provide a compelling narrative arc from first contact to post‑launch readiness.
Additional protocols (e.g., 02 Discovery Initiation, 09 Environment Setup) can be showcased if time permits.
Demo Scenario: “Building an MVP for a Startup in 6 Weeks”
Act 1: Discovery (Protocols 01–03)
• Story: A non‑technical founder has an idea for a SaaS product. They submit a high‑level job post.
• Demo: Run Protocol 01 to generate a proposal. Then simulate a brief discovery call and show
Protocol 03 transforming inputs into a project brief.

• Timing: ~2 minutes.
Act 2: Planning (Protocols 07–08)
• Story: With an approved brief, the system creates a PRD and technical design (reference Protocol 06
if needed). Protocol 08 then generates a detailed task backlog.
• Demo: Show the design document and how tasks populate automatically with priorities.
• Comparison: Contrast with manual task planning in a traditional scenario.
• Timing: ~2 minutes.
Act 3: Development & Quality (Protocols 09, 11–12)
• Story: The environment is provisioned, and development begins. Quality is enforced through
automated testing and audits.
• Demo: Display the environment diagnostics and the unified quality audit report produced by
Protocol 12.
• Timing: ~2 minutes.
Act 4: Launch & Beyond (Protocols 16–19)
• Story: The product is deployed with built‑in monitoring. Performance optimization is applied before
launch. Documentation and knowledge transfer wrap up the engagement.
• Demo: Present the monitoring dashboard, run a simulated load test, show performance
improvements, and review the documentation package.
• Timing: ~2 minutes.
Conclusion
Summarize the time saved and quality gains versus a traditional freelancer. Invite viewers to take the next
step.
Interactive Demo Elements
To engage the audience, incorporate these interactive elements:
• Clickable Protocol Demos: Create simple web interfaces where users can enter a sample job post
and watch Protocol 01 produce a proposal, or input requirements to see Protocol 08 generate a task
backlog. Provide toggles to display underlying JSON outputs like jobpost‑analysis.json or the
automation matrix.
• Before/After Comparisons: Use split screens or toggles to compare traditional artifacts (messy
notes, ad‑hoc task lists) with AI‑generated artifacts (structured briefs, task files). Encourage viewers
to switch views.
• Data Visualizations: Embed bar charts and line graphs showing timeline compression, bug
reduction and performance improvements. Allow users to hover over data points to see exact
metrics.

• Metrics Calculator: Provide a simple calculator where potential clients can enter project size and
complexity. The tool estimates time saved and cost differences between traditional freelancing and
the AI‑driven approach, based on historical averages (e.g., 40–60 % time savings).
Additional Notes
• Ensure all demo artifacts are anonymized or use fictional data to protect client confidentiality.
• Highlight the evidence packages and quality gates at each stage to emphasize transparency and
governance.
• Consider recording a full walkthrough ahead of time and then use the live demo to answer questions
and explore specific protocols in depth.
