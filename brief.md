### kung may idadagdag pang idea para dito go lang. ang mahalaga makagawa ng bagong mga protocols para sa trabaho ng ibat ibat klase ng AI projects. make sure na everyprotocols ay passed sa mga scripts na nandito `validators-system/scripts`





🎯 CORE AI/ML CONCEPTS
1. Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning
AI = Kakayahan ng mga makina na gayahin ang katalinuhan ng tao para lutasin ang mga problema
ML = Subset ng AI na nakatuon sa mga algorithm na natututo mula sa data patterns
2. Three Main ML Approaches:
Supervised Learning - Sinasanay gamit ang labeled data (input + correct output)
Unsupervised Learning - Hinahanap ang patterns sa unlabeled data
Reinforcement Learning - Natututo through rewards/punishments sa pakikipag-interact sa environment
