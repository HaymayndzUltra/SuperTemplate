+# AI-Driven Workflow Protocol System Evaluation
+
+## Executive Summary
+- **Overall protocol health:** Average completeness scored 6.96/10 and integration 6.83/10, with an overall protocol average of 6.90/10 across the 23 evaluated protocols.【F:documentation/ai-workflow-evaluation-scores.csv†L2-L24】
+- **Handoff integrity:** Only 10 of 22 sequential handoffs are fully supported by paired input/output definitions and quality gates (45% alignment), creating systemic friction between planning and execution phases.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/PROTOCOL-INTEGRATION-MAP.md†L9-L87】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L1-L200】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L1-L204】
+- **Phase coverage:** All six SDLC phases are represented, but foundational and execution phases rely on partially specified protocols lacking prerequisites, evidence summaries, and automation hooks.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00a-client-proposal-generation.md†L1-L134】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L1-L204】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/5-implementation-retrospective.md†L1-L191】
+- **Priority remediation:** Six protocols (00-generate-rules, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) require structural rewrites to meet the mandated sections and to restore downstream automation and evidence continuity.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00-generate-rules.md†L1-L152】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L1-L167】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L1-L138】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/5-implementation-retrospective.md†L1-L191】
+
+## Protocol Sequence Map
+- **Planned flow:** 00A → 00B → 01 → 00 → 00-generate-rules → 1 → 6 → 2 → 7 → 3 → 9 → 4 → 15 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 16 → 17 → 18 → 5 → 8.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/PROTOCOL-INTEGRATION-MAP.md†L9-L87】
+- **Integration anchors:** Design (Protocol 6) outputs ADRs, diagrams, and task-generation inputs, but Protocol 2 still consumes the PRD and ignores those artifacts, creating a planning gap.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/6-technical-design-architecture.md†L12-L123】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L1-L200】
+- **Evidence loops:** Deployment through sustainment protocols (10–18) maintain consistent evidence manifests and approvals, demonstrating mature later-phase governance.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/10-pre-deployment-staging.md†L1-L196】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/18-maintenance-support.md†L1-L176】

+## Integration Analysis
+### Critical Integration Points
+- **Discovery → Brief → Bootstrap:** Protocol 01 hands off artifacts consumed by Protocol 00, but 00-generate-rules lacks structure to document how rules feed the PRD and task planning stages.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/01-project-brief-creation.md†L83-L160】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00-project-bootstrap-and-context-engineering.md†L68-L131】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00-generate-rules.md†L2-L152】
+- **Design → Task Generation:** Protocol 6 exports design packages, yet Protocol 2 ignores them, forcing rework and breaking dependency mapping.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/6-technical-design-architecture.md†L72-L123】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L1-L200】
+- **Execution → Quality:** Protocol 3 never declares outputs for Protocol 9 or 4, undermining evidence flow and quality gates.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L1-L204】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/9-integration-testing.md†L1-L206】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L1-L138】
+- **Closure → Maintenance:** Protocol 5 omits a handoff to Protocol 8, creating an evidence gap for automation retrospectives.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/5-implementation-retrospective.md†L1-L191】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/8-script-governance-protocol.md†L1-L154】

+
+### Evidence Flow Analysis
+- Early phases (00A–00B) produce JSON/Markdown evidence, but lack a shared evidence manifest until Protocol 00, causing manual reconciliation when generating PRDs.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00a-client-proposal-generation.md†L13-L123】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00B-client-discovery-initiation.md†L13-L116】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/01-project-brief-creation.md†L83-L160】
+- Task execution fails to package evidence for integration testing, forcing Protocol 9 to reconstruct service coverage from scratch.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L1-L204】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/9-integration-testing.md†L1-L206】
+- Deployment through sustainment maintains consistent artifact manifests, enabling monitoring, incident response, performance, and documentation protocols to operate reliably.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/10-pre-deployment-staging.md†L1-L196】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/18-maintenance-support.md†L1-L176】
+
+### Dependency Validation
+- Circular dependency risk between task generation (Protocol 2) and environment setup (Protocol 7) because Protocol 7 requires design artifacts while Protocol 2 lacks a dependency on design approvals.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L1-L200】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/7-environment-setup-validation.md†L12-L146】
+- Missing dependencies: Protocol 4 should depend on integration evidence, yet the protocol has no declared inputs, resulting in orphaned audit workflows.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/9-integration-testing.md†L142-L206】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L1-L138】
+
+## Scoring Summary
+### System-Level Scores
+- **Overall alignment score:** 45% (10/22 handoffs fully supported).
+- **Coverage score:** 100% of SDLC phases represented, though several phases rely on incomplete protocols.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/PROTOCOL-INTEGRATION-MAP.md†L9-L87】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L1-L204】
+- **Average completeness:** 6.96/10; **average integration:** 6.83/10.【F:documentation/ai-workflow-evaluation-scores.csv†L2-L24】
+
+### Per-Protocol Score Matrix
+- Detailed numeric scores and priorities are provided in `documentation/ai-workflow-evaluation-scores.csv` for downstream analytics.【F:documentation/ai-workflow-evaluation-scores.csv†L2-L24】
+
+### Dimension Analysis
+- Planning and execution protocols (00-generate-rules, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) drive down completeness and integration averages due to missing sections and undefined handoffs.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00-generate-rules.md†L2-L152】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L1-L200】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L1-L204】
+- Later-stage protocols maintain high integration and evidence scores, demonstrating a mature operations framework ready for automation.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/10-pre-deployment-staging.md†L1-L196】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/18-maintenance-support.md†L1-L176】
+
+## Improvement Roadmap
+### Critical Fixes (Required)
+1. **Restructure incomplete protocols:** Rewrite 00-generate-rules, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to include mandatory sections (prerequisites, integration, quality gates, communication, automation, handoff) and to align inputs/outputs with adjacent protocols.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00-generate-rules.md†L2-L152】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L1-L167】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L1-L204】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L1-L138】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/5-implementation-retrospective.md†L1-L191】
+2. **Restore planning integrations:** Ensure Protocol 2 consumes design outputs from Protocol 6 and produces task evidence for Protocols 7 and 3, establishing explicit artifacts and quality gates.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/6-technical-design-architecture.md†L72-L123】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L1-L200】
+3. **Define execution-to-quality handoff:** Update Protocol 3 to emit execution manifests consumed by Protocol 9, and formalize audit inputs for Protocol 4.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L1-L204】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/9-integration-testing.md†L1-L206】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L1-L138】
+
+### High-Priority Enhancements
+1. **Add prerequisites and evidence tables:** For protocols scoring ≥8, introduce standardized prerequisites and evidence summaries to align with completeness checklist expectations.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/7-environment-setup-validation.md†L1-L154】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/11-production-deployment.md†L1-L200】
+2. **Augment automation catalogs:** Create dedicated automation sections where scripts are currently embedded inline (00A, 00B, 00, 8) to simplify tooling orchestration.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00a-client-proposal-generation.md†L13-L122】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00B-client-discovery-initiation.md†L13-L116】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/8-script-governance-protocol.md†L1-L154】
+
+### Medium-Priority Improvements
+1. **Clarify audit orchestration inputs:** Document required evidence bundles for `/review` modes and define outputs consumed by UAT coordination.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L1-L138】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/15-uat-coordination.md†L1-L164】
+2. **Standardize communication prompts:** Extend later-phase protocols with consistent status and validation prompts to match early-phase conventions.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/12-monitoring-observability.md†L1-L164】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/16-documentation-knowledge-transfer.md†L1-L176】
+
+### Nice-to-Have Additions
+1. **Evidence manifest harmonization:** Introduce a shared manifest format across all phases, linking artifacts end-to-end for analytics and compliance.
+2. **Automation validation scripts:** Provide optional CLI commands to verify protocol prerequisites before execution (e.g., `scripts/check_protocol_ready.py`).
+
+## Real-world Simulation Results
+### Scenario 1: Simple Project (Single-page CRUD)
+- **Status:** Fail. Task generation and execution lack structured handoffs, so integration testing cannot automatically consume implementation evidence, blocking progression beyond Protocol 3.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L1-L200】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L1-L204】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/9-integration-testing.md†L1-L206】
+- **Observation:** Manual intervention required to bridge planning outputs into execution.
+
+### Scenario 2: Medium Complexity (Multi-service + Migrations)
+- **Status:** Fail. Environment setup depends on technical design artifacts, but task protocol does not expose service boundaries; quality audit lacks defined inputs, preventing automated CI sign-off.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/6-technical-design-architecture.md†L72-L123】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/7-environment-setup-validation.md†L1-L154】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L1-L138】
+- **Observation:** Without clarified dependencies, CI/CD cannot enforce readiness gates.
+
+### Scenario 3: Complex Enterprise Project (Microservices + Compliance)
+- **Status:** Partial. Deployment, monitoring, incident response, performance, and documentation protocols operate cohesively, but upstream planning gaps prevent reliable production readiness packages without manual consolidation.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/10-pre-deployment-staging.md†L1-L196】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/18-maintenance-support.md†L1-L176】
+- **Observation:** Later phases are robust; early-phase governance must be repaired to support enterprise scale.
+
+### Scenario 4: Crisis Scenario (Production Incident & Rollback)
+- **Status:** Pass with caveats. Protocols 11–14 provide clear rollback, monitoring, and optimization workflows, but retrospective lacks integration to capture lessons learned automatically.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/11-production-deployment.md†L1-L200】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/14-performance-optimization.md†L1-L176】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/5-implementation-retrospective.md†L1-L191】
+- **Observation:** Incident handling is strong; post-incident learning must be codified.

+# AI-Driven Workflow Protocol System Evaluation
+
+## Executive Summary
+- Repository provides 23 protocols for the defined sequence; five expected entries are absent, so gaps are documented for missing handoffs.
+- Overall system performance shows strong execution detail in later lifecycle protocols but critical foundational and orchestration gaps remain.
+- Key blockers include missing prerequisites, absent integration mapping across planning and execution, and lack of standardized automation summaries.
+- Prioritized improvements focus on restructuring legacy protocols (Generate Rules, PRD, Task Execution), formalizing prerequisites, and repairing handoff flows.
+
+## Protocol Sequence Map
+- **Sequence:** 00a → 00B → 01 → 00 → 00-generate-rules → 1 → 6 → 2 → 7 → 3 → 9 → 4 → 15 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 16 → 17 → 18 → 5 → 8
+- Foundation → Planning → Development → Quality → Deployment → Closure phases are represented, but several transitions lack artifact mapping (detailed in Integration Analysis).

+
+## Integration Analysis
+### Critical Integration Points
+- Planning pipeline (00 → 00-generate-rules → 1 → 6 → 2 → 7) contains multiple broken handoffs where outputs are undefined or inputs are missing.
+- Quality transition from Protocol 3 to 9 works, but the subsequent Quality Audit orchestrator lacks defined inputs, blocking downstream alignment.
+- Closure loop (18 → 5 → 8) fails because the retrospective protocol lacks integration and handoff structures.
+
+### Handoff Quality Matrix
+- 00a→00B: PASS
+- 00B→01: PASS
+- 01→00: PASS
+- 00→00-generate-rules: FAIL (no outputs mapped to command)
+- 00-generate-rules→1: FAIL (command lacks outputs, PRD protocol lacks inputs)
+- 1→6: FAIL (design protocol does not consume PRD outputs)
+- 6→2: FAIL (task protocol ignores design outputs)
+- 2→7: FAIL (environment protocol relies on design/bootstrap, not task plan)
+- 7→3: FAIL (execution protocol lacks integration references)
+- 3→9: PASS
+- 9→4: FAIL (audit orchestrator lacks integration section)
+- 4→15: PASS
+- 15→10: FAIL (pre-deployment protocol omits UAT outputs)
+- 10→11: PASS
+- 11→12: PASS
+- 12→13: PASS
+- 13→14: PASS
+- 14→16: PARTIAL (documentation expects inputs but optimization protocol does not list outputs to 16)
+- 16→17: PASS
+- 17→18: PASS
+- 18→5: FAIL (retrospective lacks integration inputs)
+- 5→8: FAIL (retrospective provides no handoff to governance)
+
+### Evidence Flow Analysis
+- Evidence capture is strong in later-phase protocols (9–18) with consistent `.artifacts/` outputs.
+- Early protocols (00-generate-rules, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) either omit evidence artifacts or rely on implied documentation, breaking the traceability chain.
+
+### Dependency Validation
+- No circular dependencies detected, but prerequisite coverage is inconsistent—most protocols rely on implied readiness rather than explicit gates.
+- Missing dependencies: planning protocols do not reference rule-generation outputs; quality orchestrator does not declare inputs from integration testing.
+- Dependency ordering needs remediation across planning and closure phases to ensure artifacts exist before execution.
+
+## Scoring Summary
+### System-Level Scores
+- Overall Alignment Score: 50% perfect handoffs (11/22)
+- Coverage Score: 100% of SDLC phases represented, but effectiveness varies by phase.
+- Completeness Score: 7.22/10 average completeness across protocols.
+- Integration Score: 6.87/10 average integration score.

+
+## Improvement Roadmap
+### Critical Fixes (Required)
+- Restructure Protocols 00-generate-rules, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to include prerequisites, integration mapping, quality gates, and handoff checklists.
+- Repair planning handoffs by defining outputs from rule generation and PRD creation that feed technical design and task generation.
+- Establish prerequisites and evidence expectations across all protocols to close traceability gaps.
+
+### High-Priority Enhancements
+- Add automation hook summaries to early-phase protocols (00a, 00B, 00, 7) for operational visibility.
+- Update documentation for performance optimization to publish outputs consumed by Protocol 16.
+- Expand quality audit protocol with integration points and evidence bundles aligned to downstream consumers.
+
+### Medium-Priority Improvements
+- Standardize communication prompts across legacy protocols to match newer formats.
+- Refine evidence artifacts in planning phases to include machine-readable validation logs.
+- Link retrospective outputs to maintenance planning and script governance.
+
+### Nice-to-Have Additions
+- Provide visual workflow diagrams per phase to aid onboarding.
+- Add automation coverage dashboards summarizing script execution status.
+
+## Real-world Simulation Results
+### Scenario 1: Simple Project
+- Execution succeeds through Protocol 3, but missing integration in Protocol 3 prevents seamless transition to integration testing. Manual coordination required.
+
+### Scenario 2: Medium Complexity Project
+- Planning phase stalls because Protocols 00-generate-rules, 1, 6, and 2 do not exchange artifacts; environment setup receives incomplete inputs.
+
+### Scenario 3: Complex Enterprise Project
+- Later lifecycle protocols (9–18) manage observability, incident response, and maintenance effectively, but upstream gaps create repeated rework due to missing dependencies.
+
+### Scenario 4: Crisis Scenario
+- Incident response flow (12 → 13 → 14) performs well once monitoring data exists, yet retrospective feedback loops fail because Protocol 5 lacks handoff integration to maintenance and governance.

+# AI-Driven Workflow Protocol System Evaluation
+
+## Executive Summary
+- **Overall Alignment Score:** 45.5% (10/22 handoffs)
+- **Coverage Score:** 100% of SDLC phases represented
+- **Completeness Score:** 6.75/10 average across protocols
+- **Integration Score:** 6.64/10 average across protocols
+- **Average Overall Protocol Score:** 6.82/10
+- **Critical Findings:**
+  - 26 of 28 protocols lack explicit prerequisites, making dependency enforcement unreliable.
+  - 11 protocols are missing integration mappings, directly causing 12 broken handoffs in the orchestrated flow.
+  - Foundational planning protocols (00-generate-rules, 1, 2, 3, 4) diverge from the standard template, preventing automation and evidence continuity.
+- **High-Priority Recommendations:**
+  - Restore template compliance and integration coverage for all planning and quality protocols.
+  - Institutionalize prerequisites and evidence schemas before downstream execution begins.
+  - Update the integration map and documentation to resolve numbering conflicts and clarify optional review paths.
+
+## Protocol Sequence Map
+- **Workflow Overview:** 00a → 00B → 01 → 00-project → 00-generate-rules → 1 → 6 → 2 → 7 → 3 → 9 → 4 → 15 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 16 → 17 → 18 → 5 → 8
+- **Optional Foundations:** 0-bootstrap-your-project and 00-client-discovery precede the main flow but require integration alignment.
+- **Review Sub-Protocols:** Architecture, code, and security reviews are invoked from Protocol 4 yet lack defined entry/exit points.
+- **Key Integration Breaks:** Planning (00-project→00-rules→1→6→2→7) and quality (3→9→4→15) phases exhibit the highest defect density.
+

+- Quality gates are embedded inside phase text but not aggregated, making it harder to audit gate criteria quickly.
+#### 💡 Improvement Suggestions
+- Add an Integration Points table that lists inbound sources (job post, proposal) and outbound artifacts (brief.md, acceptance-criteria.md).
+- Collect the existing gates into a Quality Gates section with explicit pass/fail metrics for intake, signal extraction, and validation phases.
+#### Scores

+#### 💡 Improvement Suggestions
+- Add prerequisites verifying PROJECT-BRIEF.md, approval records, and required generator modules exist before bootstrapping.
+- Align integration nomenclature with the official sequence (e.g., clarify whether outputs feed Protocol 1 or a renamed Protocol 02).
+#### Scores
+- Completeness: 7/10

+## Integration Analysis
+### Critical Integration Points
+- Planning flow requires immediate remediation: missing integrations from 00-project→00-rules and 6→2 prevent architecture handoffs.
+- Quality orchestration lacks a reliable bridge from integration testing to UAT because Protocol 4 omits inputs/outputs.
+- Closure loop stalls when maintenance outputs cannot feed retrospectives or script governance.
+### Handoff Quality Matrix
+| From | To | Status | Notes |
+| --- | --- | --- | --- |
+| 00a | 00B | Pass | PROPOSAL.md and tone artifacts from 00a are explicitly consumed in 00B integration inputs. |
+| 00B | 01 | Pass | Discovery forms produced in 00B map directly to Protocol 01 inputs. |
+| 01 | 00-project | Pass | Protocol 01 hands off PROJECT-BRIEF.md which Protocol 00-project declares as required input. |
+| 00-project | 00-rules | Fail | Bootstrap outputs reference a non-existent 'Protocol 02' and 00-generate has no integration contract. |
+| 00-rules | 1 | Fail | Create PRD protocol does not acknowledge rule-generation outputs or dependencies. |
+| 1 | 6 | Fail | Technical design validates discovery artifacts but never mentions PRD deliverables from Protocol 1. |
+| 6 | 2 | Fail | Task generation lacks an integration section to receive architecture decisions. |
+| 2 | 7 | Fail | Environment setup expects design artifacts but never references task plans or backlog exports. |
+| 7 | 3 | Fail | Execution protocol has no handoff checklist consuming environment validation reports. |
+| 3 | 9 | Fail | Integration testing expects feature lists and logs, but Protocol 3 does not produce named artifacts. |
+| 9 | 4 | Fail | Quality audit orchestrator lacks integration points to accept the evidence bundle from Protocol 9. |
+| 4 | 15 | Fail | Protocol 4 does not output structured artifacts, yet UAT expects audit approvals. |
+| 15 | 10 | Fail | Pre-deployment inputs omit UAT closure manifests even though Protocol 15 produces them. |
+| 10 | 11 | Pass | Production deployment lists staging manifests and rehearsal reports from Protocol 10. |

+| 12 | 13 | Pass | Incident response lists monitoring packages and approval logs from Protocol 12. |
+| 13 | 14 | Pass | Performance optimization consumes incident timelines and deployment reports defined in Protocol 13. |
+| 14 | 16 | Pass | Documentation workflow explicitly references performance outputs and monitoring artifacts. |
+| 16 | 17 | Pass | Project closure inputs include documentation manifest and feedback backlog from Protocol 16. |
+| 17 | 18 | Pass | Maintenance protocol expects ownership matrices and transition confirmations from Protocol 17. |
+| 18 | 5 | Fail | Retrospective protocol lacks an integration section consuming maintenance outputs. |
+| 5 | 8 | Fail | Script governance expects inputs from quality audits rather than retrospective insights. |
+### Evidence Flow Analysis
+- Evidence continuity is strong in operations (Protocols 10–18) but weak upstream; PRD and task artifacts lack storage schemas, and quality reviews omit structured outputs.
+- Automation hooks often generate evidence files, yet without prerequisites the chain can start with missing or stale data.
+### Dependency Validation
+- 26 protocols lack prerequisites, so dependency ordering relies on manual interpretation.
+- No circular dependencies detected, but numbering confusion (e.g., reference to "Protocol 02") indicates documentation drift.
+- Missing integration declarations require updates to the dependency map before automation orchestration is safe.

+### Dimension Analysis
+- Prerequisites are absent in 26 protocols, the single largest structural gap.
+- Integration content is missing in 11 protocols, correlating with the 45.5% handoff success rate.
+- Communication protocols and handoff checklists are incomplete in 7 and 10 protocols respectively, impacting transparency.
+
+## Improvement Roadmap
+### Critical Fixes (Required)
+- Refactor Protocol 00-generate-rules, 1-create-prd, 2-generate-tasks, 3-process-tasks, 4-quality-audit, and review protocols to follow the mandatory section format with integration, quality, and handoff content.
+- Define explicit prerequisites across 26 protocols so handoffs do not rely on implicit narrative checks.
+- Repair broken handoffs in the planning and quality phases (00-project→00-rules, 00-rules→1, 6→2, 2→7, 3→9, 9→4, 4→15, 15→10, 18→5, 5→8).
+
+### High-Priority Enhancements
+- Standardize evidence schemas and storage paths for PRD, task, and quality audit artifacts to support automation.
+- Clarify protocol numbering and naming (e.g., "Protocol 02" references) to avoid orchestration ambiguity.
+- Ensure downstream protocols (15, 10, 11) explicitly cite the upstream artifacts they depend on (UAT packages, staging manifests, etc.).
+
+### Medium-Priority Improvements
+- Augment automation hooks with validation scripts where only manual steps exist (Protocols 00B, 2, 3, 5).
+- Aggregate distributed quality gates (e.g., Protocol 00) into formal sections to simplify auditing.
+- Extend integration maps to include optional review protocols and clarify when they are invoked.
+
+### Nice-to-Have Additions
+- Introduce dashboards or reports summarizing evidence pipeline health across phases.
+- Provide sample communication templates for deployment and incident announcements to reinforce consistent messaging.
+- Document how to recycle insights from retrospectives into rule regeneration automatically.
+
+## Real-world Simulation Results
+### Scenario 1: Simple Project
+**Status:** ❌ Fail
+- Execution halts at the quality stage because Protocol 3 does not package evidence for Protocol 9 and Protocol 4 lacks integration hooks, leaving the CRUD flow without a testable artifact trail.
+
+### Scenario 2: Medium Complexity Project
+**Status:** ❌ Fail
+- Architecture-to-task planning breaks because Protocol 2 cannot consume Protocol 6 outputs, and environment validation never receives backlog data, blocking CI/CD rehearsal.
+
+### Scenario 3: Complex Enterprise Project
+**Status:** ❌ Fail
+- While later-stage protocols (11–18) are mature, foundational gaps (Protocol 00-rules, 1, 2, 4) prevent the microservice program from ever reaching deployment readiness.
+
+### Scenario 4: Crisis Scenario
+**Status:** ⚠️ Partial
+- Incident and performance protocols contain strong workflows, but the absence of entry prerequisites (confirmed severity, active alerts) introduces manual gatekeeping risk during rollbacks and tuning.

+# AI-Driven Workflow Protocol System Evaluation
+
+## Executive Summary
+
+- Twenty-five protocol files were identified in the workflow catalog—three short of the 28-protocol target and far below the 37-protocol architecture described in the README—leading to visible coverage gaps, especially around governance and closure.【c05d9d†L1-L7】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/README.md†L15-L63】
+- Average completeness and integration scores across the evaluated protocols landed at 6.84 and 5.96 respectively, highlighting uneven structural maturity and weak handoffs between phases.【f0960e†L1-L3】
+- Strong operational guidance exists for deployment, monitoring, and incident response (Protocols 10–13) with rigorous workflows, evidence capture, and automation hooks that exemplify best practice handoffs.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/10-pre-deployment-staging.md†L1-L160】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/11-production-deployment.md†L1-L160】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/12-monitoring-observability.md†L1-L160】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/13-incident-response-rollback.md†L1-L160】
+- Early-phase protocols frequently omit prerequisites, downstream integration guidance, or quality gates (e.g., Protocols 00A, 00B, 01, 1, and 2), which undermines traceability and evidence continuity for the rest of the lifecycle.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00a-client-proposal-generation.md†L3-L124】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00B-client-discovery-initiation.md†L3-L115】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/01-project-brief-creation.md†L3-L160】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L1-L199】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L1-L200】
+- Integration mapping shows only 10 of 21 expected handoffs fully satisfied; missing prerequisites and misaligned outputs (notably 00A→00B, 1→6, and 2→7) interrupt automation and evidence flow.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/PROTOCOL-INTEGRATION-MAP.md†L8-L38】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00a-client-proposal-generation.md†L58-L123】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L1-L199】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L1-L200】
+- Complex scenario simulations exposed brittle coverage for crisis management and enterprise-scale governance because script governance and retrospective protocols lack the mandatory sections and handoff mechanics needed to close the loop.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/8-script-governance-protocol.md†L1-L80】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/5-implementation-retrospective.md†L1-L180】
+
+## Protocol Sequence Map
+
+```
+Phase 0: 00A → 00B → 01 → 00 → 1
+Phase 1-2: 1 → 6 → 2 → 7
+Phase 3: 7 → 3 → 9
+Phase 4: 9 → 4 → 15 → 10
+Phase 5: 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14
+Phase 6: 14 → 16 → 17 → 18 → 5 → 8
+```
+
+- The official integration map documents 21 sequential handoffs across the six phases above, linking discovery artifacts through deployment, operations, and sustainment.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/PROTOCOL-INTEGRATION-MAP.md†L8-L38】
+- Three protocols expected by the 28-protocol lifecycle are absent (no artifacts numbered 19–21), and the automation-focused Generate Rules command sits outside the mapped chain, creating governance blind spots in the final closure loop.【c05d9d†L1-L7】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00-generate-rules.md†L1-L150】
+- Misaligned references—such as Protocol 00A handing off to `00-client-discovery` instead of 00B, and Protocol 00’s completion message omitting its successor—cause ambiguity about the canonical flow even before reaching the planning phase.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00a-client-proposal-generation.md†L58-L123】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00-project-bootstrap-and-context-engineering.md†L69-L132】

+
+#### ❌ Gaps Identified
+- No explicit prerequisite block summarizing required discovery files and approvals before Step 1 begins, making guardrail enforcement implicit.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/01-project-brief-creation.md†L3-L54】
+- Integration assumes direct progression to Protocol 00 but does not describe how validation evidence should be consumed by bootstrap automation.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/01-project-brief-creation.md†L83-L160】
+
+#### 💡 Improvement Suggestions
+- Add a prerequisite checklist referencing `client-discovery-form.md`, `scope-clarification.md`, and approval confirmations so the protocol can enforce gating before validation scripts run.
+- Expand the integration narrative to describe how `.artifacts/briefs/` outputs are registered into bootstrap’s context kit and generator pipelines.

+
+#### Scores
+- Completeness: 7/10
+- Clarity: 7/10
+- Actionability: 7/10
+- Integration: 6/10
+- Evidence: 7/10
+- Automation: 8/10
+- **Overall: 7.0/10**
+
+### Protocol 00-GR: Generate Rules Command

+- [x] Communication cues embedded in instructions.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/0-bootstrap-your-project.md†L31-L120】
+- [ ] Handoff checklist missing; completion text is descriptive without checklist markers.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/0-bootstrap-your-project.md†L189-L195】
+
+#### ❌ Gaps Identified
+- No prerequisite or handoff checklist to connect this template bootstrap to the rest of the lifecycle, creating overlap with Protocol 00.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/0-bootstrap-your-project.md†L1-L195】
+- Quality gates are implied rather than explicit, which weakens auditability of automation-heavy steps.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/0-bootstrap-your-project.md†L48-L193】
+
+#### 💡 Improvement Suggestions
+- Add prerequisite and handoff sections clarifying when to run this template bootstrap versus the governance bootstrap (Protocol 00) and how outputs merge.
+- Convert implied gates into explicit criteria/evidence pairs so automation scripts can block on failure.

+## Integration Analysis
+
+### Critical Integration Points
+- Discovery-to-planning transitions suffer from naming mismatches (00A hands off to Protocol 00 instead of 00B) and missing prerequisites, weakening the bridge between proposal, discovery, and briefing artifacts.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00a-client-proposal-generation.md†L58-L123】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/PROTOCOL-INTEGRATION-MAP.md†L8-L15】

+
+**Overall Alignment Score:** 13/21 handoffs (61.9%) meet the protocol format requirements; the remainder require structural remediation to restore end-to-end flow.
+
+### Evidence Flow Analysis
+- Evidence generated in discovery and briefing stages is rich and traceable, but missing prerequisites in Protocols 00A, 00B, and 01 risk inconsistent ingestion when onboarding new engagements.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00a-client-proposal-generation.md†L3-L123】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00B-client-discovery-initiation.md†L13-L115】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/01-project-brief-creation.md†L13-L160】
+- Execution evidence is collected (audits, CI logs, validation artifacts) but lacks standardized manifests, causing integration testing and quality audit protocols to rely on manual coordination.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L52-L200】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/9-integration-testing.md†L95-L115】
+- Deployment, monitoring, and incident protocols maintain rigorous evidence trails, ensuring operational continuity and enabling crisis simulations.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/10-pre-deployment-staging.md†L13-L146】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/11-production-deployment.md†L13-L160】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/12-monitoring-observability.md†L13-L148】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/13-incident-response-rollback.md†L33-L154】
+- Closure evidence (documentation manifests, maintenance charters, backlog registers) is thorough but prerequisites are missing, so late-stage protocols cannot verify that upstream approvals are complete before proceeding.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/16-documentation-knowledge-transfer.md†L13-L150】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/17-project-closure.md†L13-L152】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/18-maintenance-support.md†L13-L142】
+
+### Dependency Validation
+- Dependencies described in the integration map follow a logical order without circular references, but the absence of protocols numbered 19–21 indicates missing coverage areas (e.g., governance automation) that should sit between performance optimization and documentation.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/PROTOCOL-INTEGRATION-MAP.md†L8-L38】【c05d9d†L1-L7】
+- Upstream prerequisites are inconsistently enforced: critical planning and execution protocols lack prerequisite sections, while downstream stages assume their completion, leading to latent dependency failures.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L1-L199】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L1-L200】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L1-L200】
+
+## Scoring Summary
+
+- **Overall Alignment Score:** 61.9% (13 of 21 handoffs passed the checklist). See Handoff Quality Matrix above.
+- **Coverage Score:** 25 documented protocols available versus 28 expected in the workflow specification (89.3%).【c05d9d†L1-L7】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/PROTOCOL-INTEGRATION-MAP.md†L8-L38】
+- **Average Completeness Score:** 6.84/10 across protocols.【f0960e†L1-L3】【F:documentation/ai-workflow-evaluation-scores.csv†L1-L10】
+- **Average Integration Score:** 5.96/10, driven down by missing prerequisites and absent integration sections in planning/execution phases.【f0960e†L1-L3】【F:documentation/ai-workflow-evaluation-scores.csv†L1-L10】
+- **Dimension Highlights:** Deployment-focused protocols (10–13) scored ≥8 on all dimensions, while governance protocols (00-GR, 4, 5, 8) fell below 6 due to structural gaps.【F:documentation/ai-workflow-evaluation-scores.csv†L1-L15】
+
+## Improvement Roadmap
+
+### Critical Fixes (Required)
+- **Repair planning/execution handoffs** by adding integration, quality gates, and handoff checklists to Protocols 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 so downstream automation can consume PRDs, task plans, audits, retrospectives, and governance outputs.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L1-L199】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L1-L200】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L1-L200】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L20-L113】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/5-implementation-retrospective.md†L1-L180】【F:8-script-governance-protocol.md†L1-L80】
+- **Correct discovery sequence alignment** by updating Protocol 00A’s handoff and Protocol 00’s completion text to match the official integration map and prevent evidence from skipping required steps.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00a-client-proposal-generation.md†L58-L123】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00-project-bootstrap-and-context-engineering.md†L120-L132】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/PROTOCOL-INTEGRATION-MAP.md†L8-L18】
+- **Formalize missing protocols** (19–21 placeholders) or adjust the lifecycle map to reflect the 25 available protocols to remove ambiguity around governance coverage.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/PROTOCOL-INTEGRATION-MAP.md†L8-L38】【c05d9d†L1-L7】
+
+### High-Priority Enhancements
+- **Add prerequisite sections** to Protocols 00A, 00B, 01, 00, 2, 3, 7, 12, 14, 16, 17, and 18 to enforce entry conditions before execution begins.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00a-client-proposal-generation.md†L3-L57】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00B-client-discovery-initiation.md†L3-L54】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/01-project-brief-creation.md†L3-L54】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00-project-bootstrap-and-context-engineering.md†L1-L67】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L1-L200】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L1-L200】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/7-environment-setup-validation.md†L1-L40】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/12-monitoring-observability.md†L1-L40】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/14-performance-optimization.md†L1-L40】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/16-documentation-knowledge-transfer.md†L1-L40】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/17-project-closure.md†L1-L40】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/18-maintenance-support.md†L1-L40】
+- **Define evidence manifests** for execution and quality protocols so integration testing, audits, and retrospectives share consistent artifact schemas.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L52-L200】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L20-L113】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/9-integration-testing.md†L95-L115】
+- **Strengthen automation hooks** in discovery and governance by documenting scripts or templates for Protocols 00B and 00-client-discovery as well as the Generate Rules command.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00B-client-discovery-initiation.md†L13-L115】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00-client-discovery.md†L56-L199】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00-generate-rules.md†L2-L150】
+
+### Medium-Priority Improvements
+- **Align deployment-to-monitoring knowledge transfer** by explicitly referencing observability baselines in Protocol 10 outputs and adding prerequisite checks in Protocol 12.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/10-pre-deployment-staging.md†L83-L160】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/12-monitoring-observability.md†L1-L148】
+- **Automate defect feedback loops** by routing UAT defect registers to execution task backlogs and maintenance planning to ensure closure of user feedback.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/15-uat-coordination.md†L47-L111】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/18-maintenance-support.md†L85-L115】
+- **Clarify maintenance-to-retrospective cadence** by embedding scheduling automation in Protocol 18’s handoff to Protocol 5.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/18-maintenance-support.md†L85-L142】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/5-implementation-retrospective.md†L15-L170】
+
+### Nice-to-Have Additions
+- **Enhance communication templates** with standardized message formats for Protocols 00A, 00B, 1, and 2 to reduce variance in stakeholder-facing language.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00a-client-proposal-generation.md†L88-L109】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00B-client-discovery-initiation.md†L80-L103】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L18-L199】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L51-L126】
+- **Provide governance dashboards** by pairing Protocol 8 with automated reporting on rule compliance and circular validation outcomes.【F:8-script-governance-protocol.md†L1-L80】
+- **Document scenario playbooks** (simple, medium, complex, crisis) next to Protocol 13 and 14 to accelerate future incident drills and performance tuning sessions.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/13-incident-response-rollback.md†L9-L154】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/14-performance-optimization.md†L9-L147】
+
+## Real-world Simulation Results
+
+### Scenario 1: Simple Project (CRUD SPA)
+- **Outcome:** Partial success. Foundation protocols produce rich discovery and briefing artifacts, but the lack of prerequisites and integration in Protocols 00A, 00B, and 01 introduces manual guardrails to confirm inputs before bootstrap can begin.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00a-client-proposal-generation.md†L3-L123】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/00B-client-discovery-initiation.md†L3-L115】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/01-project-brief-creation.md†L3-L160】
+- **Impact:** Task planning stalls because Protocols 1 and 2 do not publish explicit handoffs, forcing human intervention to assemble PRD-derived tasks for execution.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/1-create-prd.md†L1-L199】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/2-generate-tasks.md†L1-L200】
+
+### Scenario 2: Medium Complexity (Multi-service with Migrations)
+- **Outcome:** Blocked. Architecture and environment protocols (6 and 7) provide detailed outputs and validation gates, yet task execution cannot pass evidence to integration testing due to missing manifests in Protocol 3, causing automated CI validation to stop.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/6-technical-design-architecture.md†L9-L153】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/7-environment-setup-validation.md†L80-L110】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/3-process-tasks.md†L1-L200】
+- **Impact:** Quality audit and UAT receive inconsistent inputs because Protocol 4 lacks a handoff structure, so migration validation evidence must be reassembled manually before deployment rehearsals.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/4-quality-audit.md†L20-L113】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/15-uat-coordination.md†L80-L155】
+
+### Scenario 3: Complex Enterprise (Microservices, Compliance, Observability)
+- **Outcome:** Mostly successful through deployment and operations. Protocols 10–14 enforce comprehensive automation, quality gates, and integration points, enabling observability, incident response, and performance tuning to run smoothly under compliance constraints.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/10-pre-deployment-staging.md†L13-L160】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/11-production-deployment.md†L13-L160】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/12-monitoring-observability.md†L13-L148】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/13-incident-response-rollback.md†L9-L154】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/14-performance-optimization.md†L9-L147】
+- **Impact:** Closure and maintenance proceed, but missing prerequisite gates in Protocols 16–18 and the absence of lifecycle protocols 19–21 limit governance coverage and long-term automation plans.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/16-documentation-knowledge-transfer.md†L1-L150】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/17-project-closure.md†L1-L152】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/18-maintenance-support.md†L1-L142】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/PROTOCOL-INTEGRATION-MAP.md†L8-L38】

+### Scenario 4: Crisis Scenario (Production Incident)
+- **Outcome:** Strong incident handling. Monitoring, incident response, and rollback protocols provide detailed automation hooks, evidence requirements, and communication cadences, enabling quick mitigation and post-incident documentation.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/12-monitoring-observability.md†L13-L148】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/13-incident-response-rollback.md†L33-L154】
+- **Impact:** Recovery insights do not automatically propagate into retrospectives or script governance because Protocol 5 lacks integration guidance and Protocol 8 is non-procedural, reducing the effectiveness of the feedback loop after resolution.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/5-implementation-retrospective.md†L1-L180】【F:8-script-governance-protocol.md†L1-L80】
