**# Protocol Validation Verification Report**
**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Verified By**: ChatGPT (gpt-5-codex)

## Overall Status
- [ ] ✅ PASSED - All deliverables consistent, no gaps found
- [ ] ⚠️ PASSED WITH NOTES - Minor discrepancies found (documented below)
- [x] ❌ FAILED - Significant inconsistencies or missing gaps detected

## Verification Results
### Step 1: Protocol Count ✅
- protocol-inventory.json: 28 protocols (IDs 00-27)
- dependency-map.mermaid: 23 unique mainline protocols (P01-P23)
- Discrepancies: None

### Step 2: Gap Count ✅
- find-missing.md total: 21 gaps (10+7+1+3)
- validation-summary.md total: 21 gaps (10+7+1+3)
- Match: Yes
- Discrepancies: None

### Step 3: Dependency Consistency ❌
- Spot-checked protocols: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19
- Mismatches found:
  - dependency-map.mermaid omits dotted edges for future prerequisites documented in protocol-inventory.json and source files (e.g., P21 artifacts required by Protocols 11-15).
  - Protocol 14 prerequisites reference Protocol 20, but the map shows only P15/P19 dotted edges and no representation of the P20 dependency.

### Step 4: Evidence Citations ✅
- Total citations checked: 11 (full list reviewed, 5 spot-checked in source files)
- Invalid citations: 0
- Details: All referenced files exist and line ranges support the documented gaps.

### Step 5: Severity Consistency ❌
- CRITICAL count match: No (find-missing entries = 5, summary table correct; however, individual listings misalign: e.g., Gap 1 labeled CRITICAL in body but HIGH in validation-summary Top 10 table)
- HIGH count match: No (find-missing body shows 3 HIGH entries, summary tables claim 4)
- MEDIUM count match: Partial (counts align, but table distributions mismatch narrative)
- LOW count match: No (body lists 4 LOW items vs. summary table’s 3)
- Discrepancies: Severity breakdown tables in both find-missing.md and validation-summary.md do not reflect actual per-gap severities.

### Step 6: Handoff Target Verification ✅
- Verified claims: 10/10
- Incorrect claims: 0/10
- Details: All documented incorrect handoffs confirmed in protocol source files.

### Step 7: Circular Dependency Verification ❌
- Verified claims: 5/7
- Incorrect claims: 2/7
- Details:
  - Protocol 11 prerequisites reference Protocol 21 but not Protocol 19 (contrary to documented claim).
  - Protocol 14 prerequisites pull artifacts from Protocol 19, 15, and 20 (if available), not Protocol 21 as stated. Missing dependency on Protocol 20 is also unmodeled in the map.

### Step 8: Missing Gaps Detection ❌
- Additional gaps found: 2
- Details:
  1. Protocol 14 prerequisite requires Protocol 20 artifacts (Phase 6) – future dependency not captured in gap list.
  2. Protocol 19 prerequisite list includes self-referential artifacts (`QUALITY-AUDIT-PACKAGE.zip` and `OBSERVABILITY-BASELINE.md` from Protocol 19) plus additional future dependencies (e.g., Protocol 20 incident postmortems) beyond the single documented circular issue.

### Step 9: SDLC Coverage ✅
- All phases covered: Yes (Client Discovery through Closure each mapped to at least one protocol)
- Missing phases: None

### Step 10: Final Consistency ❌
- Cross-file consistency: Fail
- Issues: Missing dependency edges in mermaid map, severity mismatches, and undocumented additional gaps cause cross-deliverable contradictions.

## Summary of Findings
### Confirmed Accurate
- Protocol count alignment across inventory and dependency map.
- Total gap count and categorical breakdown (10+7+1+3) consistent between analyses.
- Evidence citations in find-missing.md are valid and substantiated by source protocols.
- Documented incorrect handoffs accurately reflect protocol content.

### Discrepancies Found
- Dependency map omits several prerequisite relationships (especially Protocol 21 dependencies), diverging from inventory gap notes and protocol files.
- Severity breakdown tables in both reports misrepresent actual per-gap severities; specific gaps are labeled differently between documents.
- Circular dependency section overstates Protocol 11’s reliance on Protocol 19 and omits Protocol 14’s reliance on Protocol 20.

### Missing Gaps Discovered
1. Protocol 14 depends on Protocol 20 artifacts (Phase 6) – future dependency not documented.
2. Protocol 19 contains self-referential prerequisites and additional future dependencies (Protocols 20 & 21) beyond the recorded circular issue.

### Recommended Actions
1. Update dependency-map.mermaid to include all documented prerequisite relationships (especially Protocol 21 → P11/P12/P13/P14/P15 and Protocol 20 → P14) and align with protocol-inventory gap notes.
2. Correct severity assignments in both find-missing.md and validation-summary.md to match per-gap classifications and recalc category totals.
3. Revise circular dependency documentation for Protocols 11 and 14 to reflect actual prerequisites, and add new gap entries for Protocol 14 → Protocol 20 and Protocol 19’s self/future dependencies.

## Conclusion
Multiple cross-file inconsistencies remain across the validation deliverables—dependency relationships, severity distributions, and gap coverage are not synchronized. Additional undocumented gaps were identified. The validation package requires revision before it can be considered complete and reliable.
