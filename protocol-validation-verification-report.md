**# Protocol Validation Verification Report**
**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Verified By**: gpt-5-codex

## Overall Status
- [ ] ✅ PASSED - All deliverables consistent, no gaps found
- [ ] ⚠️ PASSED WITH NOTES - Minor discrepancies found (documented below)
- [x] ❌ FAILED - Significant inconsistencies or missing gaps detected

## Verification Results

### Step 1: Protocol Count ✅
- protocol-inventory.json: 28 protocols
- dependency-map.mermaid: 23 unique protocols (P01-P23)
- Discrepancies: `grep -c` command counted 71 due to multiple protocol references per line; unique ID count confirms 23

### Step 2: Gap Count ✅
- find-missing.md total: 21 gaps
- validation-summary.md total: 21 gaps
- Match: Yes
- Discrepancies: None

### Step 3: Dependency Consistency ✅
- Spot-checked protocols: P11, P12, P15, P19
- Mismatches found: None (listed dependencies align with mermaid edges; circular issues documented as dotted lines and gap notes)

### Step 4: Evidence Citations ❌
- Total citations checked: 23
- Invalid citations: 1
- Details: "Standard Workflow Missing Coverage" gap cites task requirements instead of repository evidence file

### Step 5: Severity Consistency ❌
- CRITICAL count match: No (find-missing table lists 5, which matches, but HIGH and LOW counts differ from actual section severities)
- HIGH count match: No (summary claims 4 HIGH, detailed sections contain 3)
- Discrepancies: Severity breakdown tables in both summaries do not match per-gap severities (also P11→P19 handoff labeled HIGH in summary but CRITICAL in detailed gap)

### Step 6: Handoff Target Verification ✅
- Verified claims: 10/10
- Incorrect claims: 0/10
- Details: All incorrect handoffs confirmed via protocol files (P06, P09, P10, P11, P12, P13, P15, P16, P17, P05)

### Step 7: Circular Dependency Verification ✅
- Verified claims: 7/7
- Incorrect claims: 0/7
- Details: Each prerequisite section references future protocols exactly as documented

### Step 8: Missing Gaps Detection ✅
- Additional gaps found: 0
- Details: No new incorrect handoffs or circular dependencies discovered beyond documented set

### Step 9: SDLC Coverage ✅
- All phases covered: Yes
- Missing phases: None

### Step 10: Final Consistency ❌
- Cross-file consistency: Fail
- Issues: Severity distribution mismatch between find-missing.md and validation-summary.md; invalid evidence citation contradicts "all citations valid" claim

## Summary of Findings

### Confirmed Accurate
- 28 protocols enumerated in inventory with supporting IDs 00-27
- Dependency map covers 23 mainline protocols with arrows matching listed dependencies
- Gap totals and category counts (10/7/1/3 = 21) consistent between analysis files
- Documented incorrect handoffs and circular dependencies accurately mirror protocol source content

### Discrepancies Found
- Severity distribution table (both files) misstates HIGH/LOW counts and contradicts per-gap severities
- Validation summary labels P11 handoff gap as HIGH, but detailed analysis tags same issue as CRITICAL
- One gap (SDLC coverage) lacks repository evidence citation despite evidence standards claim

### Missing Gaps Discovered
- None

### Recommended Actions
1. Correct severity breakdowns in find-missing.md and validation-summary.md to reflect actual per-gap severities (5 CRITICAL / 3 HIGH / 9 MEDIUM / 4 LOW) and align descriptions (e.g., P11 handoff severity).
2. Replace the non-file evidence reference in "Standard Workflow Missing Coverage" with a concrete repository artifact or mark as unverifiable.
3. Update validation-summary top-ten table entries to match detailed gap severities and descriptions after severity corrections.

## Conclusion
Severity reporting and evidence traceability require revision before deliverables can be approved. All other structural checks pass, but inconsistent severity metrics and one invalid citation break the "evidence-complete" standard.

**Verification Status**: NEEDS REVISION
