# Sample PR Comparison Analysis

The output below is an excerpt generated by running

```bash
python scripts/compare_pull_requests.py --input documentation/sample_pr_data.json
```

against the curated offline dataset. It demonstrates how the comparator now
surfaces review signals, conflict hotspots, dependency-aware ordering, and
actionable follow-ups in a single Markdown report.

## High-Level Summary

| PR | Title | State | Risk | Priority | Action |
|----|-------|--------|------|----------|--------|
| #1 | Add Batch 1 design-to-operations protocols and generator assets | Open | Medium | High | üîÑ Update branch |
| #3 | Add architecture, environment, and operations workflow protocols | Open | High | High | üõ†Ô∏è Fix change requests |
| #4 | Add Batch 1 critical deployment and operations protocols | Open | High | Critical | üßπ Resolve conflicts |
| #8 | Add protocol reference mapping and validation collateral | Open | Low | Medium | üö¢ Merge after checks |

Key takeaways:

- **PR #3** is blocked on a change request from `architect-guru` and shares files
  with the rest of the batch, so it should be tackled immediately after updating
  PR #1.
- **PR #4** inherits both dependency and mergeability blockers, making it the
  riskiest item in the queue until earlier work lands.
- **PR #8** is mergeable with two approvals but touches the shared runbook, so it
  should merge after PR #3 resolves its outstanding review.

## Review Signals

| PR | Approvals | Change Requests | Mergeable | Tests? |
|----|-----------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| #1 | 1 | 0 | behind | ‚úÖ |
| #3 | 0 | 1 | dirty | ‚Äî |
| #4 | 0 | 0 | blocked | ‚Äî |
| #8 | 2 | 0 | clean | ‚Äî |

Use this table to understand reviewer sentiment at a glance: prioritize PRs with
pending change requests or merge conflicts before merging the clean ones.

## Dependency Map

- PR #1 depends on #0
- PR #3 depends on #1
- PR #4 depends on #3
- PR #8 has no listed dependencies

## Recommended Review/Merge Order

1. PR #1 ‚Äì Update the base branch and re-run checks.
2. PR #3 ‚Äì Address the change request and re-queue for review.
3. PR #4 ‚Äì Rebase once PR #3 lands, then resolve remaining conflicts.
4. PR #8 ‚Äì Merge after the shared runbook changes stabilize.

## Conflict Hotspots

- PR #1 overlaps with PRs #3 and #4 on protocol files.
- PR #3 overlaps with every other PR via the shared runbook.
- PR #4 and PR #8 both modify `docs/operations/runbook.md`, so merge carefully.

## Detailed Notes Snapshot

Each PR section in the generated report captures links, branch info, change size,
tests touched, risk/priority rationales, review statistics, mergeability, and a
body summary snippet. Use those sections when triaging reviewer assignments or
assembling status updates.

## Reproducing the Report

- Offline: `python scripts/compare_pull_requests.py --input documentation/sample_pr_data.json`
- Live data: `python scripts/compare_pull_requests.py --repo owner/name 17 19 20`
- Alternative formats: append `--format text` for TSV-style output or
  `--format json` for machine-readable consumption.

This refreshed example mirrors the enhanced capabilities described in the PR
comparison study and can be adapted to any repository by swapping the input data
or pointing the script at GitHub directly.
