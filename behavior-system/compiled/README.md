# behavior-system/compiled

This directory contains **pre-compiled system messages** that combine:

1. The **Kernel** (Silent Prompt Enhancement) summary.  
2. The **Guard Stack** (10 behavioral layers) summary.  
3. A specific **Mode Profile** (e.g., LLM Behavior Setup Expert).

Use these compiled examples as:

- Reference for how to assemble system prompts for different personas.  
- Starting points when configuring providers or orchestration frameworks.  
- Documentation of which rules are active for each deployed configuration.
