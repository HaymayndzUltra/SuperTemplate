## PHASE MAP

### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions

**Step 1:** Freelance Solutions Architect Identity with Truthfulness Constraint (ref. L26-L30)
- Reasoning: Lines 26-30 establish the AI's role as a "Freelance Solutions Architect" with a critical mission constraint prohibiting fabrication of experience, deliverables, or guarantees beyond validated capabilities.
- Meta-heuristic: **Truth-Bounded Agency** - Define agent identity with explicit ethical boundaries that prevent capability misrepresentation.

**Step 2:** Evidence-Based Capability Representation (ref. L30, L65-L70, L99)
- Reasoning: Lines 30, 65-70, and 99 enforce that all differentiators, strengths, and proposal claims must trace back to verified evidence from discovery notes and validated capabilities.
- Meta-heuristic: **Verifiable Claims Architecture** - All assertions must be grounded in documented evidence with traceable provenance.

**Step 3:** Multi-Gate Quality Assurance Framework (ref. L132-L168)
- Reasoning: Lines 132-168 define five quality gates with quantitative thresholds (≥0.9 completeness, ≥0.8 confidence, ≥0.95 structure score) and automated validation scripts.
- Meta-heuristic: **Layered Quality Enforcement** - Implement multiple validation checkpoints with measurable criteria to ensure output integrity.

**Step 4:** Human-Centric Proposal Philosophy (ref. L28, L82-L85)
- Reasoning: Lines 28 and 82-85 mandate transformation of job posts into "human-centric" proposals with empathy, narrative variation, and paraphrased client language to avoid robotic tone.
- Meta-heuristic: **Humanization-First Communication** - Embed empathy and natural language variation as core quality requirements, not optional enhancements.

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control

**Step 5:** Prerequisite Artifact Enforcement (ref. L8-L23)
- Reasoning: Lines 8-23 define strict prerequisites including required artifacts (`JOB-POST.md`, project profile), approvals (discovery lead confirmation), and system state requirements (script access, validation tools).
- Meta-heuristic: **Pre-Execution Dependency Validation** - Block protocol initiation until all upstream artifacts, approvals, and tooling are confirmed available.

**Step 6:** Phase-Level Halt Conditions (ref. L42, L61, L78, L102)
- Reasoning: Each workflow step includes explicit halt conditions that pause execution when data is missing (L42), confidence is low (L61), content conflicts exist (L78), or validation discrepancies occur (L102).
- Meta-heuristic: **Defensive Progression Gates** - Embed conditional pauses at critical decision points to prevent execution with incomplete or conflicting information.

**Step 7:** Compliance and Real Validation Gates (ref. L155-L160)
- Reasoning: Lines 155-160 define Gate 4 requiring HIPAA compliance checks, PHI violation detection, and security configuration validation with real validation scripts.
- Meta-heuristic: **Regulatory Compliance Enforcement** - Embed domain-specific compliance validation as mandatory quality gates with automated verification.

**Step 8:** Handoff Validation Checklist (ref. L265-L274)
- Reasoning: Lines 265-274 require comprehensive validation of prerequisites, workflow steps, quality gates, evidence artifacts, integration outputs, and automation hooks before protocol completion.
- Meta-heuristic: **Exit Gate Completeness** - Enforce multi-dimensional completion criteria before downstream protocol handoff.

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic

**Step 9:** Job Post Analysis Procedure (ref. L36-L53)
- Reasoning: Lines 36-53 define a two-step procedure to parse `JOB-POST.md` for objectives, deliverables, tone signals, and risks, then cross-reference with existing discovery notes for context enrichment.
- Meta-heuristic: **Context Extraction and Enrichment Algorithm** - Parse source documents, extract structured data, and enrich with historical context from prior engagements.

**Step 10:** Tone Classification and Strategy Mapping (ref. L55-L70)
- Reasoning: Lines 55-70 outline a two-step procedure to classify communication tone (technical, executive, urgent) with confidence scoring, then curate validated differentiators relevant to client scenario.
- Meta-heuristic: **Adaptive Communication Strategy Selection** - Classify stakeholder communication style and select matching proposal framing heuristics.

**Step 11:** Proposal Drafting and Humanization Procedure (ref. L72-L94)
- Reasoning: Lines 72-94 define a three-step procedure to generate structured proposal sections, apply humanization filters (narrative variation, empathy tokens), and include optional value-add elements.
- Meta-heuristic: **Structured Generation with Humanization Layer** - Generate content following templates, then apply post-processing filters to inject natural language variation.

**Step 12:** Multi-Layer Validation Execution (ref. L96-L112)
- Reasoning: Lines 96-112 outline a two-step procedure to execute validation suite (grammar, accuracy, empathy coverage, readability) and prepare reviewer summary with key decisions and risks.
- Meta-heuristic: **Automated Validation with Human Review Preparation** - Run automated checks, then compile human-readable summary for stakeholder review.

**Step 13:** Automated Script Orchestration (ref. L213-L229)
- Reasoning: Lines 213-229 provide bash commands to execute prerequisite validation, compliance checks, quality gate automation, and evidence aggregation scripts in sequence.
- Meta-heuristic: **Script-Driven Quality Pipeline** - Orchestrate validation procedures through automated scripts to ensure consistency and repeatability.

**Step 14:** Manual Fallback Procedures (ref. L255-L259)
- Reasoning: Lines 255-259 define manual validation procedures when automation is unavailable, including manual job post review, peer review of tone/accuracy, and outcome documentation.
- Meta-heuristic: **Graceful Degradation to Manual Process** - Provide documented manual alternatives when automation fails, preserving governance integrity.

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar

**Step 15:** Branded Status Announcement Templates (ref. L173-L181)
- Reasoning: Lines 173-181 provide standardized announcement templates for phase transitions using "MASTER RAY™" branding, signaling discovery intake, tone classification, drafting, validation, completion, and errors.
- Meta-heuristic: **Branded Progress Broadcasting** - Use consistent, branded communication templates to signal protocol state transitions and build stakeholder recognition.

**Step 16:** Evidence-Based Validation Prompt (ref. L183-L193)
- Reasoning: Lines 183-193 define a structured validation prompt template that lists all evidence artifacts (jobpost-analysis, tone-map, proposal, validation report) and requests explicit approval to proceed.
- Meta-heuristic: **Evidence-Enumerated Consent Request** - Present complete evidence inventory and request explicit approval before downstream handoff.

**Step 17:** Structured Error Communication (ref. L195-L207)
- Reasoning: Lines 195-207 provide a structured error template that identifies the failed gate, explains criteria, reports actual state, specifies required action, and presents resolution options.
- Meta-heuristic: **Contextual Error Reporting with Resolution Paths** - Communicate failures with full context, criteria, actual state, and actionable resolution options.

**Step 18:** Phase-Specific Progress Markers (ref. L40-L41, L59-L60, L76-L77, L83-L84, L100-L101)
- Reasoning: Each workflow step includes a standardized communication marker that announces the current phase and specific action being performed (e.g., "Analyzing client opportunity", "Mapping client tone").
- Meta-heuristic: **Transparent Activity Signaling** - Broadcast current activity with specific action descriptions to maintain stakeholder awareness and trust.

## COMMENTARY

**Architectural Dependencies:**
- **Upstream Dependency (Protocol 04)**: Lines 12, 119 require `JOB-POST.md` from Protocol 04 (client discovery), establishing the protocol's position in the workflow sequence.
- **Lateral Dependency (Protocol 02)**: Line 120 references `discovery-brief.md` from Protocol 02 for prior discovery intelligence, showing bidirectional integration between proposal generation and discovery.
- **Downstream Handoff (Protocols 02 & 03)**: Lines 123-124 specify that `PROPOSAL.md` feeds Protocol 02 (client outreach) and `proposal-summary.json` feeds Protocol 03 (project brief creation), creating a fan-out pattern.
- **Automation Layer Dependencies**: Lines 19-22 require access to multiple validation scripts (`analyze_jobpost.py`, `tone_mapper.py`, `validate_proposal.py`, `check_hipaa.py`, `enforce_gates.py`), creating a dependency on the automation infrastructure.
- **Evidence Storage Architecture**: Lines 126-128 establish `.artifacts/protocol-01/` as primary evidence store and `.cursor/context-kit/` for context artifacts, mirroring the storage pattern from Protocol 02.

**Meta-Engineering Heuristics:**
- **Truth-Bounded Generation**: The critical constraint at L30 prohibiting fabrication establishes a "verifiable claims only" philosophy, where every proposal assertion must trace to validated evidence.
- **Humanization as Quality Dimension**: Lines 82-85 treat humanization not as optional polish but as a mandatory quality requirement with logged evidence (`humanization-log.json`), elevating empathy to first-class status.
- **Multi-Gate Quality Assurance**: Five quality gates (L132-168) create a layered validation strategy covering intake (Gate 1), strategy (Gate 2), structure (Gate 3), compliance (Gate 4), and final approval (Gate 5).
- **Confidence-Based Gating**: Gate 2 (L141-146) uses confidence scoring (≥0.8 threshold) to determine when manual intervention is required, implementing adaptive automation.
- **Compliance-First Design**: Gate 4 (L155-160) embeds HIPAA compliance validation as a mandatory gate, demonstrating domain-specific regulatory awareness.

**Cognitive Role Modularity:**
- **Planner:** Lines 55-70 (Tone and Strategy Mapping) perform planning functions by classifying communication style and selecting proposal framing heuristics.
- **Executor:** Lines 36-53 (Discovery Context Intake) and 72-94 (Proposal Drafting) perform execution by parsing job posts, generating structured proposals, and applying humanization filters.
- **Validator:** Lines 96-112 (Validation and Approval Prep) and 132-168 (Quality Gates) perform validation by executing validation suites and enforcing quality criteria.
- **Auditor:** Lines 291-308 (Evidence Summary) and 105-112 (Reviewer Summary) perform auditing by tracking artifacts, metrics, and preparing human-readable summaries.

## INFERENCE SUMMARY

Protocol 01 represents a **Truth-Bounded Proposal Generation Framework** that transforms client job posts into human-centric proposals while enforcing strict verifiability constraints. The core design philosophy is **humanization-first communication with evidence-based claims**, where every proposal assertion must trace to validated capabilities and empathy is treated as a measurable quality dimension. The protocol provides a **multi-gate quality contract** that guarantees downstream protocols receive validated, compliant, and human-reviewed proposals. Key architectural innovations include: (1) **Confidence-based adaptive gating** that triggers manual intervention when automation confidence is low, (2) **Humanization as first-class quality requirement** with logged evidence and empathy token coverage metrics, (3) **Embedded compliance validation** (HIPAA) as a mandatory quality gate, and (4) **Truth-bounded generation constraint** that prohibits capability fabrication. This framework ensures that proposal generation is systematic, ethical, auditable, and produces high-confidence outputs for client engagement while maintaining regulatory compliance and human-centric communication standards.
