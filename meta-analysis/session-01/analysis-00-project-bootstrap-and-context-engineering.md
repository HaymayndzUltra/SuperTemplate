## PHASE MAP

### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions
**Step 1:** AI Role Definition and Mission Statement (ref. L3-L5)
- Reasoning: Lines 3-5 establish the AI persona as "AI Codebase Analyst & Context Architect" with explicit mission to transform Project Brief into governed scaffold
- Meta-heuristic: Role-based system architecture with clear persona assignment and mission-driven execution

**Step 2:** Governance Constraint Establishment (ref. L7)
- Reasoning: Line 7 establishes critical safety boundary prohibiting production code modification and requiring containment in governed directories
- Meta-heuristic: Safety-first design with explicit operational boundaries and containment principles

**Step 3:** Non-Destructive Operation Philosophy (ref. L7)
- Reasoning: The guardrail explicitly mandates non-destructive operations, establishing architectural principle of preservation
- Meta-heuristic: Immutable transformation pattern with evidence-based validation requirements

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control
**Step 1:** Phase-Based Validation Gates (ref. L15-L17, L25-L27, L35-L37, L45-L47)
- Reasoning: Each phase contains explicit quality gates with criteria, evidence requirements, and failure handling mechanisms
- Meta-heuristic: Deterministic progression with validation checkpoints and rollback capabilities

**Step 2:** Halt Condition Controls (ref. L12, L20, L28, L36)
- Reasoning: Multiple halt conditions throughout execution prevent unsafe progression and require explicit confirmation
- Meta-heuristic: Human-in-the-loop safety with explicit consent requirements

**Step 3:** Evidence Collection Requirements (ref. L19-L21, L29-L31, L39-L41, L49-L51)
- Reasoning: Each phase mandates specific evidence collection with defined storage locations and validation criteria
- Meta-heuristic: Audit-driven execution with traceable artifact generation

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic
**Step 1:** Sequential Script Execution (ref. L9-L11, L15-L17, L23-L25, L31-L33, L39-L41, L47-L49)
- Reasoning: Concrete script invocations with specific parameters, output locations, and execution sequences
- Meta-heuristic: Tool-chain orchestration with deterministic command execution

**Step 2:** Data Flow Pipeline (ref. L55-L57)
- Reasoning: Clear input/output mapping showing data transformation from PROJECT-BRIEF.md through validation to scaffold generation
- Meta-heuristic: Pipeline-based data transformation with explicit artifact dependencies

**Step 3:** Environment Validation Sequence (ref. L15-L17)
- Reasoning: Systematic environment health checking with dependency validation and tool availability confirmation
- Meta-heuristic: Infrastructure readiness validation with dependency resolution

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar
**Step 1:** Status Announcement Templates (ref. L10, L18, L26, L34, L42, L50)
- Reasoning: Standardized communication patterns with phase start/complete announcements and automation status reporting
- Meta-heuristic: Structured telemetry with consistent announcement formats

**Step 2:** Validation Prompt Dialogs (ref. L67-L70)
- Reasoning: User-facing confirmation prompts with explicit yes/no decision points and context-specific messaging
- Meta-heuristic: Consent-driven progression with explicit user validation requirements

**Step 3:** Error Handling Communication (ref. L72-L74)
- Reasoning: Structured error messaging with specific error types, recovery steps, and contextual information
- Meta-heuristic: Failure-aware communication with recovery guidance and diagnostic information

## COMMENTARY

**Architectural Dependencies:**
- Subsystem A (Brief Validation) provides validated PROJECT-BRIEF.md to Subsystem C (Scaffold Generation) (ref. L55-L57)
- Subsystem B (Environment Preparation) ensures system readiness for all downstream operations (ref. L23-L25)
- Subsystem C generates scaffold artifacts consumed by Subsystem D (ref. L55-L57)
- All subsystems depend on evidence collection mechanisms for audit trail (ref. L19-L21, L29-L31, L39-L41, L49-L51)

**Meta-Engineering Heuristics:**
- Deterministic orchestration with explicit phase dependencies and validation gates
- Safety-first design with non-destructive operations and containment principles
- Evidence-driven execution with comprehensive audit trail requirements
- Human-in-the-loop validation with explicit consent mechanisms

**Cognitive Role Modularity:**
- **Planner:** Brief validation and dry run phases (L8-L21) establish execution plan
- **Executor:** Script execution phases (L22-L49) perform concrete operations
- **Validator:** Quality gates throughout (L17-L19, L31-L33, L45-L47, L63-L65) ensure correctness
- **Auditor:** Evidence collection and workflow validation (L49-L63) provide governance oversight

## INFERENCE SUMMARY

This represents an "evidence-driven context loader framework" that transforms approved project briefs into governed development environments through deterministic orchestration. The core design philosophy emphasizes safety-first operations with comprehensive audit trails and human validation checkpoints. The protocol provides a contract guaranteeing non-destructive scaffold generation with complete traceability and rollback capabilities. Key architectural innovations include phase-based validation gates, evidence collection requirements, and consent-driven progression mechanisms that ensure governance compliance throughout the bootstrap process.
