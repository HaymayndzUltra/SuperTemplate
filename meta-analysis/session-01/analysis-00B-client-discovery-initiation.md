## PHASE MAP

### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions
**Step 1:** Mission-Driven Discovery Architecture (ref. L5-L6)
- Reasoning: Line 5 establishes the core mission to "systematize the initial discovery process that follows a positive client response, ensuring complete clarification of scope, requirements, and expectations before any development begins"
- Meta-heuristic: Evidence-driven requirement validation before technical planning

**Step 2:** Role-Based Behavioral Constraints (ref. L5-L7)
- Reasoning: Line 5 assigns "Freelance Solutions Architect" role, while Line 7 establishes critical constraint prohibiting technical planning until discovery completion
- Meta-heuristic: Role-specific governance boundaries prevent premature technical decisions

**Step 3:** Safety-First Discovery Protocol (ref. L7-L7)
- Reasoning: Line 7 explicitly prohibits proceeding to technical planning or proposal submission until all client discovery questions are answered and validated
- Meta-heuristic: Validation-gated progression ensures complete requirement understanding

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control
**Step 1:** Halt-Condition Validation Gates (ref. L17-L17, L53-L53)
- Reasoning: Lines 17 and 53 establish halt conditions that stop protocol execution when client reply is unclear or before finalizing collaboration setup
- Meta-heuristic: Human-in-the-loop validation prevents incomplete data collection

**Step 2:** Quality Gate Enforcement (ref. L65-L78)
- Reasoning: Lines 65-78 define three quality gates with specific criteria, evidence requirements, and failure handling mechanisms
- Meta-heuristic: Multi-dimensional validation ensures comprehensive discovery completeness

**Step 3:** State Transition Controls (ref. L97-L97)
- Reasoning: Line 97 establishes validation prompt requiring explicit user approval before protocol completion
- Meta-heuristic: Consent-driven state transitions ensure user control over workflow progression

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic
**Step 1:** Sequential Discovery Phases (ref. L11-L54)
- Reasoning: Lines 11-54 define three sequential phases with specific steps, actions, and evidence collection requirements
- Meta-heuristic: Structured data collection methodology ensures systematic requirement gathering

**Step 2:** Evidence Collection Pipeline (ref. L18-L18, L24-L24, L32-L32, L38-L38, L46-L46, L52-L52)
- Reasoning: Lines 18, 24, 32, 38, 46, and 52 specify evidence artifacts with storage locations in `.artifacts/discovery/`
- Meta-heuristic: Traceable evidence management enables downstream validation and audit

**Step 3:** Integration Data Flow (ref. L58-L61)
- Reasoning: Lines 58-61 define input consumption from Protocol 00A and output provision to Protocol 01
- Meta-heuristic: Protocol-chained data transformation enables workflow continuity

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar
**Step 1:** Phase-Based Status Announcements (ref. L84-L92)
- Reasoning: Lines 84-92 define standardized announcement templates for phase start, completion, and data recording status
- Meta-heuristic: Consistent telemetry enables workflow monitoring and progress tracking

**Step 2:** Validation Dialog Templates (ref. L97-L97)
- Reasoning: Line 97 establishes user-facing validation prompt requiring explicit approval for protocol completion
- Meta-heuristic: Consent-driven communication ensures user control over critical workflow transitions

**Step 3:** Error Recovery Communication (ref. L101-L102)
- Reasoning: Lines 101-102 define error message templates with specific recovery actions for missing client response and incomplete requirements
- Meta-heuristic: Structured error handling enables graceful failure recovery

## COMMENTARY

**Architectural Dependencies:**
- Discovery Workflow (Subsystem A) depends on Integration Management (Subsystem D) for input data from Protocol 00A (ref. L58-L58)
- Quality Validation (Subsystem B) consumes evidence artifacts generated by Discovery Workflow phases (ref. L18-L52)
- Communication Control (Subsystem C) provides status updates and validation prompts that gate progression through Discovery Workflow phases (ref. L17-L17, L53-L53)
- Integration Management outputs validated discovery data to Protocol 01, enabling downstream project brief generation (ref. L60-L61)

**Meta-Engineering Heuristics:**
- **Evidence-Driven Validation**: All procedural steps require evidence collection with specific storage locations, ensuring traceability and audit capability
- **Human-in-the-Loop Control**: Critical decision points require explicit user validation, preventing automated progression without human oversight
- **Fail-Safe Discovery**: Multiple halt conditions and quality gates ensure incomplete discovery cannot proceed to technical planning phases
- **Protocol Chaining**: Clear input/output contracts enable seamless integration with upstream (00A) and downstream (01) protocols

**Cognitive Role Modularity:**
- **Planner:** Discovery Workflow phases (L11-L54) perform systematic requirement gathering strategy
- **Executor:** Individual step actions (L14-L14, L21-L21, L29-L29, etc.) perform concrete discovery activities
- **Validator:** Quality Gates (L65-L78) perform evidence validation and completeness checking
- **Auditor:** Evidence collection requirements (L18-L52) perform traceability and documentation management

## INFERENCE SUMMARY

This represents a **structured discovery orchestration framework** designed to ensure complete requirement validation before technical planning begins. The core design philosophy centers on evidence-driven validation with human oversight at critical decision points. The protocol provides a contract guaranteeing that no technical planning occurs until all discovery questions are answered and validated through multiple quality gates. Key architectural innovations include halt-condition validation, multi-dimensional quality gates, and protocol-chained data flow that enables seamless integration with upstream proposal generation and downstream project brief creation phases.
