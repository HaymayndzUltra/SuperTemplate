## PHASE MAP

### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions
**Step 1:** Freelance Solutions Architect Role Definition (ref. L5-L7)
- Reasoning: Lines 5-7 establish the AI persona as "Freelance Solutions Architect" with explicit mission to validate discovery artifacts and generate client-approved Project Brief
- Meta-heuristic: Role-based specialization ensures domain expertise alignment with project scoping requirements

**Step 2:** Critical Guardrail Enforcement (ref. L9-L9)
- Reasoning: Line 9 establishes non-negotiable constraint prohibiting brief generation without validated artifacts and client confirmation
- Meta-heuristic: Safety-first governance prevents premature execution and ensures stakeholder alignment

**Step 3:** Project-Scoping Domain Compliance (ref. L1-L1)
- Reasoning: Header establishes domain compliance tag ensuring protocol operates within project scoping boundaries
- Meta-heuristic: Domain-specific protocols maintain focused scope and prevent scope creep

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control
**Step 1:** Discovery Validation Gate (ref. L15-L15)
- Reasoning: Line 15 establishes halt condition requiring all discovery artifacts to be validated before proceeding
- Meta-heuristic: Input validation gates prevent downstream failures from incomplete upstream data

**Step 2:** Client Approval Checkpoint (ref. L35-L35)
- Reasoning: Line 35 establishes mandatory halt condition requiring client confirmation before protocol completion
- Meta-heuristic: Stakeholder consent gates ensure business alignment and prevent unauthorized execution

**Step 3:** Quality Gate Enforcement (ref. L45-L50)
- Reasoning: Lines 45-50 establish three-tier quality gate system with specific criteria and failure handling
- Meta-heuristic: Multi-layer validation ensures comprehensive quality control with clear recovery paths

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic
**Step 1:** Sequential Phase Execution (ref. L11-L36)
- Reasoning: Lines 11-36 establish three-phase execution sequence: Validation → Assembly → Approval
- Meta-heuristic: Sequential phase progression ensures logical dependency resolution and systematic completion

**Step 2:** Evidence Collection Protocol (ref. L20-L22, L28-L30, L38-L40)
- Reasoning: Multiple evidence collection points establish systematic artifact generation and storage
- Meta-heuristic: Evidence-driven execution ensures traceability and audit compliance

**Step 3:** Automation Hook Integration (ref. L52-L60)
- Reasoning: Lines 52-60 establish specific automation scripts for each phase with expected outputs
- Meta-heuristic: Tool integration enables scalable execution and reduces manual overhead

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar
**Step 1:** Phase Announcement Templates (ref. L13-L13, L25-L25, L33-L33)
- Reasoning: Standardized phase start announcements provide consistent progress reporting
- Meta-heuristic: Structured communication ensures stakeholder visibility and protocol transparency

**Step 2:** Validation Prompt Framework (ref. L42-L42)
- Reasoning: Line 42 establishes standardized validation request format for user confirmation
- Meta-heuristic: Consent-driven communication patterns ensure human oversight and approval

**Step 3:** Error Handling Templates (ref. L44-L46)
- Reasoning: Lines 44-46 establish specific error message formats with recovery instructions
- Meta-heuristic: Structured error communication enables systematic troubleshooting and resolution

## COMMENTARY
**Architectural Dependencies:**
- Subsystem A (Validation) must complete before Subsystem B (Assembly) can begin, as evidenced by the prerequisite requirement in L15
- Subsystem B (Assembly) depends on validated artifacts from Subsystem A, creating a data dependency chain
- Subsystem C (Approval) requires completed brief from Subsystem B and client confirmation, establishing both artifact and stakeholder dependencies
- Subsystem D (Quality Control) operates across all phases, providing continuous validation and integration management

**Meta-Engineering Heuristics:**
- Deterministic orchestration: Sequential phase progression with clear dependencies prevents race conditions
- Safety-first design: Multiple validation gates and halt conditions ensure no unauthorized execution
- Evidence-driven execution: Systematic artifact collection ensures audit trail and traceability
- Stakeholder-centric governance: Client approval gates ensure business alignment

**Cognitive Role Modularity:**
- **Planner:** Subsystem A performs planning by validating inputs and ensuring readiness
- **Executor:** Subsystem B performs execution by assembling the project brief
- **Validator:** Subsystem C performs validation through automated checks and client approval
- **Auditor:** Subsystem D performs auditing through quality gates and integration management

## INFERENCE SUMMARY
This represents an "evidence-driven project scoping framework" that ensures comprehensive validation and stakeholder alignment before project execution begins. The core design philosophy centers on safety-first governance with systematic evidence collection and client consent validation. The protocol provides a contract guaranteeing that no project brief will be generated without complete discovery validation and explicit client approval. Key architectural innovations include the three-tier quality gate system and the integration of automation hooks with human oversight checkpoints.
