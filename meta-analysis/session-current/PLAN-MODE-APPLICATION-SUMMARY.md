## Identified Issues

### Priority 1: Critical
**Issue**: Legacy `.md` file in rules directory  
**File**: `.cursor/rules/AGENTS.md`  
**Impact**: Not discoverable by Cursor's rule system  
**Solution**: Migrate to `.mdc` format (artifacts ready)  
**Status**: Migration guide and new file prepared  

### Priority 2: Enhancement
**Issue**: Root-level rules organization  
**Files**: Multiple `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/` root  
**Impact**: Functional but less organized  
**Solution**: Consider classifying and moving to subdirectories  
**Status**: Recommendation documented  

### Priority 3: Documentation
**Issue**: PLAN-MODE.md duplication  
**Files**: `meta-analysis/PLAN-MODE.md` and `6-master-rule-how-to-create-effective-rules.mdc`  
**Impact**: None (files are identical)  
**Solution**: Consider making PLAN-MODE.md a reference document  
**Status**: Informational note added  

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Review** the generated `8-master-rule-external-agent-interpretation.mdc` file
2. **Execute** migration steps from migration guide:
   ```bash
   # Move new file to correct location
   mv meta-analysis/session-current/8-master-rule-external-agent-interpretation.mdc \
      .cursor/rules/master-rules/8-master-rule-external-agent-interpretation.mdc
   
   # Archive legacy file
   mkdir -p .cursor/rules/archive
   mv .cursor/rules/AGENTS.md .cursor/rules/archive/AGENTS.md.legacy
   ```
3. **Test** rule discovery in Cursor
4. **Verify** rule applies correctly when triggered

### Short-Term Actions (Priority 2)
1. Review root-level rules for proper classification
2. Consider reorganizing into subdirectories:
   - `common-rules/` for cross-project rules
   - `tools/` for tool-specific rules
3. Add anti-pattern examples to reference-style rules

### Long-Term Actions (Priority 3)
1. Document rule organization strategy in README
2. Create rule discovery guide for contributors
3. Add compliance checklist to rule creation workflow
4. Consider automated compliance validation
