### Current Structure Assessment
**✅ OPTIMAL STRUCTURE - NO CHANGES NEEDED**

The current PLAN-MODE.md structure is perfectly aligned with plan mode protocol standards and represents an exemplary implementation of:

1. **Consent-driven planning framework** with read-only enforcement
2. **AI-driven format selection** that reduces cognitive load
3. **Enhanced workflow options** covering all major use cases
4. **Comprehensive user interaction protocols** with deterministic mapping
5. **Complete integration** with FORMATS.md and FORMATS2.md systems

### Integration Recommendations
**✅ ALREADY OPTIMALLY INTEGRATED**

The protocol demonstrates perfect integration with:
- Existing Cursor plan mode system
- FORMATS.md and FORMATS2.md format selection
- Enhanced workflow options (D-I)
- User response handling protocols
- Evidence-based planning methodology

### Future Enhancement Opportunities
**LOW PRIORITY** - Current implementation is excellent, but consider:
