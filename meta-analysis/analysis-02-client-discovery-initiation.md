## PHASE MAP

### Layer 1: System-Level Decisions

**Step 1:** Freelance Solutions Architect Role Definition (ref. L25-L29)
- Reasoning: Lines 25-29 establish the AI's operational identity as a "Freelance Solutions Architect" with a mission to orchestrate structured discovery and produce authoritative artifacts, with a critical prohibition against advancing without complete validation.
- Meta-heuristic: **Role-Based Mission Scoping** - Define agent identity, operational boundaries, and critical constraints before procedural execution.

**Step 2:** Evidence-Driven Progression Constraint (ref. L8-L22)
- Reasoning: Lines 8-22 mandate prerequisite artifacts, approvals, and system states before execution can begin, enforcing a strict dependency chain.
- Meta-heuristic: **Artifact-Gated Execution** - No protocol phase may commence without validated inputs from upstream protocols and explicit stakeholder approval.

**Step 3:** Client-Centric Validation Architecture (ref. L29, L41, L60, L83, L90, L108)
- Reasoning: Multiple halt conditions throughout the protocol require explicit client confirmation before proceeding, establishing a human-in-the-loop governance model.
- Meta-heuristic: **Consent-Driven Orchestration** - Every phase transition requires explicit client validation, preventing autonomous scope drift.

**Step 4:** Quality Gate Governance Framework (ref. L136-L165)
- Reasoning: Lines 136-165 define four quality gates with pass thresholds, evidence requirements, and automated validation scripts, creating a deterministic quality assurance layer.
- Meta-heuristic: **Automated Quality Enforcement** - Embed quantitative quality gates with automation hooks to enforce compliance before downstream handoff.

### Layer 2: Behavioral Control

**Step 5:** Prerequisite Enforcement Mechanism (ref. L8-L22)
- Reasoning: Lines 8-22 define strict checklists for required artifacts, approvals, and system states that must be validated before protocol execution.
- Meta-heuristic: **Pre-Execution Validation Gates** - Block protocol initiation until all upstream dependencies are satisfied and documented.

**Step 6:** Phase-Level Halt Conditions (ref. L41, L60, L83, L90, L108)
- Reasoning: Each workflow step includes explicit halt conditions that pause execution when data is incomplete or client confirmation is pending.
- Meta-heuristic: **Defensive State Transitions** - Embed conditional pauses at critical decision points to prevent execution with incomplete information.

**Step 7:** Quality Gate Pass/Fail Criteria (ref. L138-L142, L145-L150, L152-L157, L159-L164)
- Reasoning: Each quality gate defines quantitative pass thresholds (e.g., ≥95% coverage, ≥0.9 completeness score) and explicit failure handling procedures.
- Meta-heuristic: **Quantitative Quality Enforcement** - Use measurable criteria and automated validation to enforce quality standards deterministically.

**Step 8:** Handoff Validation Checklist (ref. L247-L257)
- Reasoning: Lines 247-257 require validation of all prerequisites, workflow steps, quality gates, evidence artifacts, and automation hooks before protocol completion.
- Meta-heuristic: **Exit Gate Validation** - Enforce comprehensive completion criteria before downstream protocol handoff.

### Layer 3: Procedural Logic

**Step 9:** Context Alignment Procedure (ref. L35-L52)
- Reasoning: Lines 35-52 define a two-step procedure to synthesize proposal highlights, capture business background, and log results in structured artifacts.
- Meta-heuristic: **Context Synthesis Algorithm** - Extract and structure client context from multiple sources into standardized evidence artifacts.

**Step 10:** Requirement Deep Dive Procedure (ref. L54-L75)
- Reasoning: Lines 54-75 outline a three-step procedure to facilitate feature prioritization, validate technical requirements, and capture risks/assumptions.
- Meta-heuristic: **Structured Requirement Elicitation** - Guide stakeholders through systematic requirement capture using templates and classification frameworks.

**Step 11:** Delivery Framework Alignment Procedure (ref. L77-L100)
- Reasoning: Lines 77-100 define a three-step procedure to confirm timeline/budget, establish communication plans, and define decision governance.
- Meta-heuristic: **Collaboration Contract Establishment** - Formalize delivery expectations, communication protocols, and decision-making authority.

**Step 12:** Discovery Confirmation Procedure (ref. L102-L116)
- Reasoning: Lines 102-116 outline a two-step procedure to summarize discovery outcomes, obtain client approval, and archive communication evidence.
- Meta-heuristic: **Validation and Archival Protocol** - Compile evidence, obtain explicit approval, and preserve audit trail for governance.

**Step 13:** Automated Validation Execution (ref. L211-L223)
- Reasoning: Lines 211-223 provide bash commands to execute prerequisite validation, quality gate automation, and evidence aggregation scripts.
- Meta-heuristic: **Script-Driven Quality Assurance** - Automate validation procedures to reduce human error and enforce consistency.

**Step 14:** Manual Fallback Procedure (ref. L237-L241)
- Reasoning: Lines 237-241 define manual validation procedures when automation is unavailable, including live review, written confirmation, and manual logging.
- Meta-heuristic: **Graceful Degradation to Manual Process** - Provide documented manual alternatives when automation fails, preserving governance integrity.

### Layer 4: Communication Grammar

**Step 15:** Status Announcement Templates (ref. L170-L178)
- Reasoning: Lines 170-178 provide standardized announcement templates for phase transitions, completion, and error states using the MASTER RAY™ branding.
- Meta-heuristic: **Branded Status Broadcasting** - Use consistent, branded communication templates to signal protocol state transitions.

**Step 16:** Validation Prompt Structure (ref. L180-L191)
- Reasoning: Lines 180-191 define a structured validation prompt template that lists evidence artifacts and requests explicit client approval.
- Meta-heuristic: **Evidence-Based Consent Request** - Present structured evidence summary and request explicit approval before proceeding.

**Step 17:** Error Handling Communication (ref. L193-L205)
- Reasoning: Lines 193-205 provide a structured error template that identifies the failed gate, explains criteria, reports actual state, and presents resolution options.
- Meta-heuristic: **Structured Error Reporting** - Communicate failures with context, criteria, actual state, and actionable resolution paths.

**Step 18:** Phase-Specific Communication Markers (ref. L39-L40, L58-L59, L65-L66, L81-L82, L88-L89, L106-L107)
- Reasoning: Each workflow step includes a standardized communication marker that announces the current phase and action being performed.
- Meta-heuristic: **Transparent Progress Signaling** - Broadcast current activity to maintain stakeholder awareness and trust.

## COMMENTARY

**Architectural Dependencies:**
- **Upstream Dependency (Protocol 01)**: Lines 12-13 require `PROPOSAL.md` and `proposal-summary.json` from Protocol 01, establishing a strict sequential dependency chain.
- **Downstream Handoff (Protocol 03)**: Lines 126-127 specify that `client-discovery-form.md`, `scope-clarification.md`, and `discovery-recap.md` are consumed by Protocol 03 for project brief creation.
- **Context Kit Integration (Protocol 04)**: Lines 124, 128, and 132 show bidirectional integration with Protocol 04 for organizational context and communication plans.
- **Quality Gate Automation**: Lines 143, 150, 157, and 164 reference Python validation scripts that enforce gate criteria, creating a dependency on the automation layer defined in Subsystem F.
- **Evidence Storage Architecture**: Lines 130-132 establish `.artifacts/protocol-02/` as the primary evidence store and `.cursor/context-kit/` for context artifacts, creating a structured data flow pattern.

**Meta-Engineering Heuristics:**
- **Evidence-Driven Development**: Every workflow step (Subsystem B) produces documented evidence artifacts that serve as both audit trail and input for downstream protocols.
- **Defensive Orchestration**: Multiple halt conditions (L41, L60, L83, L90, L108) prevent autonomous progression without explicit client validation, embodying a "fail-safe" design philosophy.
- **Quantitative Quality Assurance**: Quality gates (Subsystem D) use measurable thresholds (≥95%, ≥0.9) rather than subjective criteria, enabling automated enforcement.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Manual fallback procedures (L237-241) ensure protocol can execute even when automation fails, maintaining governance integrity.
- **Branded Communication**: Consistent use of "MASTER RAY™" branding (Subsystem E) creates professional identity and stakeholder recognition.

**Cognitive Role Modularity:**
- **Planner:** Lines 35-52 (Context Alignment) and 77-100 (Delivery Framework Alignment) perform planning functions by synthesizing requirements and establishing collaboration frameworks.
- **Executor:** Lines 54-75 (Requirement Deep Dive) and 102-116 (Discovery Confirmation) perform execution by facilitating client interactions and capturing structured data.
- **Validator:** Lines 136-165 (Quality Gates) and 247-257 (Handoff Checklist) perform validation by enforcing quality criteria and completion requirements.
- **Auditor:** Lines 273-291 (Evidence Summary) and 112-116 (Archive Communication Evidence) perform auditing by tracking artifacts, metrics, and maintaining audit trails.

## INFERENCE SUMMARY

Protocol 02 represents an **Evidence-Driven Client Discovery Framework** that transforms unstructured client conversations into validated, structured artifacts for downstream consumption. The core design philosophy is **consent-driven orchestration with defensive state transitions**, where every phase requires explicit client validation and produces documented evidence before progression. The protocol provides a **quality-gated handoff contract** that guarantees downstream protocols receive complete, validated discovery artifacts with quantitative quality assurance. Key architectural innovations include: (1) **Multi-layer halt conditions** that prevent autonomous scope drift, (2) **Automated quality gates with manual fallbacks** for graceful degradation, (3) **Branded communication templates** for professional stakeholder engagement, and (4) **Bidirectional integration patterns** that feed both forward (Protocol 03) and lateral (Protocol 04) protocol dependencies. This framework ensures that client discovery is systematic, auditable, and produces high-confidence inputs for project planning.
