### Protocol 4: Quality Audit Orchestrator

| | **REPORT 1** | **REPORT 2** | **REPORT 3** | **REPORT 4** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PROBLEMS** | **Missing role heading, integration points, quality gates, communication, automation summary, and handoff checklist.** | **Missing integration mapping.** No defined quality gates and evidence requirements. No handoff checklist. | **Missing role/mission, integration, quality gates, and handoff sections.** Evidence expectations not standardized. | Missing integration points or quality gates. Evidence expectations are "implicit." |
| **SUGGESTIONS** | **Recast** to standard protocol template with explicit inputs, outputs, and quality gates. | Add "Integration Points." Define quality gates. Create "handoff checklist." | **Convert** to standard protocol format. Provide "consolidated evidence schema." | Add explicit inputs/outputs. Introduce quality gates. |

| | **REPORT 1** | **REPORT 2** | **REPORT 3** | **REPORT 4** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PROBLEMS** | No critical problems; prerequisites "inferred through Gate 1." | No "explicit prerequisites" summarizing required integration and quality audit approvals. | Prerequisites for ready-to-test builds, sign-off from quality audit, and participant list "not formalized." | No structural problems. |
| **SUGGESTIONS** | Add "explicit prerequisites" covering UAT-ready staging environment and signed quality audit. | Add "prerequisites checklist" verifying Protocol 9 sign-off, quality audit status, and staging readiness. | Add prerequisites covering approved quality audit results and staging builds availability. | Encourage automated syncing of defect data back to Protocol 3 task tracker. |
| **OVERALL SCORE** | **8.17 / 10** | **8.67 / 10** | **8.17 / 10** | **7.67 / 10** |

### Protocol 8: Script Governance

| | **REPORT 1** | **REPORT 2** | **REPORT 3** | **REPORT 4** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PROBLEMS** | Automation hooks are "implied." No prerequisites and evidence summaries. | No defined prerequisites. | No confirmation of prerequisites for script checking. | **Narrative policy only, not actionable workflow.** Missing almost all sections. |
| **SUGGESTIONS** | Add "prerequisites list" and "automation hook section." | Add "prerequisites checklist." | Add prerequisites. Clarify evidence schemas. | **Redesign** as structured protocol with phases, evidence, automation hooks, and handoffs. |
| **OVERALL SCORE** | **6.17 / 10** | **7.83 / 10** | **7.17 / 10** | **4.67 / 10** |

### Protocol 10: Pre-Deployment Staging

| | **REPORT 1** | **REPORT 2** | **REPORT 3** | **REPORT 4** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PROBLEMS** | No critical problems. | Prerequisites to confirm UAT outcomes and quality audit approvals "not explicit." | No "prerequisites section" (e.g., validated UAT sign-off, ready release package). | No problems; "exemplifies deployment readiness best practices." |
| **SUGGESTIONS** | Document prerequisite approvals (UAT sign-off, integration evidence) "explicitly." | Add "prerequisites checklist" covering UAT closure, quality audit sign-off, and integration evidence. | Add prerequisites verifying UAT completion, release manifest readiness, and environment credentials. | Add explicit linkage to Protocol 12 for observability baselines. |
| **OVERALL SCORE** | **8.33 / 10** | **8.83 / 10** | **8.33 / 10** | **8.67 / 10** |

### Protocol 11: Production Deployment & Release Management

| | **REPORT 1** | **REPORT 2** | **REPORT 3** | **REPORT 4** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PROBLEMS** | No critical problems. | Prerequisites to verify final go/no-go approvals "implied but not formalized." | Prerequisites not "explicitly" requiring signed staging report and release approvals. | No problems; "thoroughly addresses production release governance." |
| **SUGGESTIONS** | Add "prerequisites summary" referencing Protocol 10 and 7 artifacts. | Add "prerequisites checklist" referencing Protocol 10 readiness approvals and rollback artifacts. | Add prerequisites ensuring staging rehearsal reports, rollback playbooks, and stakeholder approvals exist. | Highlight dependencies on incident response drill results to strengthen readiness. |
| **OVERALL SCORE** | **8.33 / 10** | **8.83 / 10** | **8.33 / 10** | **8.67 / 10** |

### Protocol 12: Post-Deployment Monitoring & Observability

| | **REPORT 1** | **REPORT 2** | **REPORT 3** | **REPORT 4** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PROBLEMS** | No critical problems. | No "explicit prerequisites" confirming deployment artifacts and monitoring baseline availability. | Prerequisites should ensure deployment verification data and SLO baselines are available. | Prerequisites are "explicit" but should reference deployment manifests and staging baselines. |
| **SUGGESTIONS** | Include prerequisites referencing deployment report acceptance. | Add prerequisites covering deployment reports, go/no-go approvals, and baseline dashboards. | Add prerequisites referencing production deployment logs and service ownership details. | Add "prerequisite checklist" requiring `PRE-DEPLOYMENT-PACKAGE.zip` and deployment manifests. |
| **OVERALL SCORE** | **8.33 / 10** | **8.83 / 10** | **7.83 / 10** | **7.83 / 10** |

### Protocol 13: Incident Response & Rollback

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PROBLEMS** | No critical problems. | No prerequisites confirming monitoring alerts or incident triggers are formally recognized. | Prerequisites to enter incident mode (e.g., declared severity, monitoring alerts) "not formalized as a gate." | No problems; "incident governance is well documented." |
| **SUGGESTIONS** | Document prerequisites (active incident detection, monitoring outputs) at top. | Add "prerequisites checklist" ensuring alert confirmation, severity triage, and stakeholder notification. | Add "prerequisites section" requiring confirmed incident tickets, severity level, and active monitoring signals. | Introduce explicit linkage to retrospective automation to ensure corrective actions automatically feed into Protocol 5. |
| **OVERALL SCORE** | **8.33 / 10** | **8.83 / 10** | **8.17 / 10** | **8.5 / 10** |

### Protocol 14: Performance Optimization & Tuning

| | **REPORT 1** | **REPORT 2** | **REPORT 3** | **REPORT 4** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PROBLEMS** | No critical problems. | Prerequisites to confirm telemetry availability and incident inputs "implied but not formalized." | Prerequisites for existing monitoring baselines and incident data "not explicitly listed." | No "prerequisite section," reducing confidence that production telemetry is available. |
| **SUGGESTIONS** | Add prerequisites summarizing monitoring baselines. | Add "prerequisites checklist" covering monitoring baselines, incident reports, and deployment data. | Add prerequisites referencing monitoring dashboards, incident history, and performance targets. | Add "prerequisite checklist" requiring monitoring baselines and incident reports. |
