Plan Overview
Create 12 new protocols with corresponding generators and circular validation to complete the entire project development lifecycle from client discovery to production maintenance, supporting simple to complex projects across all technology stacks.
Execution Strategy
Batch 1 (Critical Path - 5 protocols): Design, Environment, Deployment, Monitoring, Incident Response
Batch 2 (Quality & Validation - 4 protocols): Integration Testing, Pre-Deployment, UAT, Performance
Batch 3 (Completion - 3 protocols): Documentation, Closure, Maintenance
Protocol Generation Approach
Follow exact format from /generators/protocol-generator-instructions.md
Use protocol-input-form.yaml template structure
Create generators simultaneously with protocols
Execute circular validation for each protocol
Generate comprehensive quality gates for every phase
