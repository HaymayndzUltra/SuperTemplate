# AI-Driven Workflow System

## üöÄ Overview

The **AI-Driven Workflow System** is a comprehensive, 28-protocol development lifecycle that transforms AI from a simple code generator into a reliable engineering partner. This system provides structured, evidence-based workflows for complete software development from client discovery to project closure.

### Core Philosophy
- **"Why Before How"**: Every action must align with cognitive dependencies
- **Developer Cognitive Loop**: Protocols follow natural developer thinking patterns
- **Reasoning Integrity**: Automation extends reasoning, never replaces it
- **Evidence-Based**: All actions must be validated and documented

### Key Benefits
- ‚úÖ **Complete SDLC Coverage**: From client proposal to project closure
- ‚úÖ **Quality Assurance**: Built-in quality gates and validation
- ‚úÖ **Evidence-Based Delivery**: All work documented and validated
- ‚úÖ **Client-Ready**: Professional workflows for client projects
- ‚úÖ **Automation Integration**: Scripts and CI/CD integration
- ‚úÖ **Scalable**: From simple projects to complex enterprise systems

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Missing Prerequisites
- Ensure all prerequisites are met before protocol execution
- Check required artifacts and approvals
- Validate system state requirements

#### Incomplete Evidence
- Verify evidence collection is complete
- Check evidence format and structure
- Ensure all validation results are documented

#### Failed Quality Gates
- Address gate failures immediately
- Review failure reasons and implement fixes
- Re-run gate validation after fixes

#### Integration Problems
- Check protocol dependencies
- Verify handoff requirements
- Ensure proper sequence execution

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Validate protocol structure
python scripts/validate_protocols.py

# Test protocol execution
python scripts/test_protocol_execution.py
