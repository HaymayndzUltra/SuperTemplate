# Real-World Readiness Assessment

## Executive Summary
- **Readiness score:** Weighted production readiness totals **3.73/10**, well below the 7.5 “near ready” threshold; protocol completeness is the only dimension above 5/10, while script integration lags at 2.5/10 because critical automation is missing.【3533a3†L1-L19】
- **Lifecycle bottlenecks:** Early freelance-facing steps execute with partial automation, but discovery handoffs, planning validation, integration testing, and governance collapse due to absent gate runners and evidence aggregators.【5906f2†L134-L167】【8ba875†L136-L165】【b5f2c8†L18-L193】
- **Decision:** **NO-GO** – autonomous delivery is not achievable until gate orchestration, evidence aggregation, and governance automation are implemented end to end.

## Scenario Testing
### Freelance Project (Job Post → Delivery)
1. **Proposal drafting (Protocol 01):** Automation covers job analysis and tone mapping, but structural validation and gate orchestration scripts are missing, so proposal quality gates require manual intervention before submission.【5906f2†L134-L167】【b5f2c8†L18-L25】
2. **Discovery (Protocol 02):** Requirement, expectation, and confirmation gates have no backing scripts, forcing consultants to reconcile artifacts by hand and delaying client approvals.【8ba875†L136-L165】【b5f2c8†L26-L35】
3. **Brief creation and bootstrap (Protocols 03–05):** Critical validators such as `validate_brief_structure.py`, `aggregate_evidence_00.py`, and `validate_principles.py` are absent, so the AI cannot guarantee scope alignment or governance readiness without human review.【a20ce7†L130-L205】【79179f†L153-L238】【5b16d5†L185-L211】【b5f2c8†L36-L71】
4. **Downstream phases:** Planning, execution, and testing protocols cite nonexistent gate runners, meaning the freelance delivery cannot reach automated QA, staging, or deployment without engineering support.【b5f2c8†L72-L137】

**Outcome:** Automation halts after discovery, breaching freelance platform expectations for timely, evidence-backed deliverables.

### Enterprise Project (Compliance & Multi-Team)
1. **Regulatory checks:** Protocol 01 demands HIPAA validation (`check_hipaa.py`, `enforce_gates.py`) but lacks structure validators, while later protocols require compliance evidence that cannot be generated because the aggregate evidence and reporting scripts are missing.【5906f2†L134-L167】【b5f2c8†L18-L149】
2. **Change governance:** Protocol 23 expects inventory, documentation audits, static analysis, and remediation backlogs, yet the supporting scripts and artifact templates do not exist, preventing enterprise audit readiness and SOX-style traceability.【b0f694†L24-L104】【b5f2c8†L150-L193】
3. **Cross-team handoffs:** Planning (06–09) and quality (12–14) phases rely on nonexistent validators, leaving architecture decisions, backlog decomposition, UAT coordination, and staging rehearsals entirely manual – a critical blocker for enterprise release management.【a20ce7†L130-L205】【b5f2c8†L72-L133】

**Outcome:** Compliance attestation, segregation of duties, and deployment rehearsals fail, so the workflow cannot satisfy enterprise governance or audit requirements.

### Startup MVP (Speed & Iteration)
1. **Manual halt conditions:** Every early-phase protocol embeds halt prompts that require human confirmation, and without gate automation the AI pauses frequently, destroying the rapid iteration expected in MVP builds.【5906f2†L171-L179】【8ba875†L168-L205】【5b16d5†L229-L251】
2. **Task execution:** Protocol 10 references only `update_task_state.py`; all other gates for preflight, quality, and session closeout are missing, so iterative development relies on manual QA and status updates.【b5f2c8†L102-L117】
3. **Feedback loops:** Without retrospective automation (`aggregate_evidence_5.py`, `generate_retrospective_report.py`) or maintenance validators, the team cannot quickly capture learnings or update service-level backlogs.【b5f2c8†L150-L193】

**Outcome:** The system cannot sustain rapid pivots or automated retrospectives, undermining startup agility.

## Go/No-Go Recommendation
- **Decision:** **NO-GO** – All scenarios fail to progress past planning because quality gates lack executable automation. Enterprise compliance and startup speed both collapse without evidence aggregation and governance tooling.
- **Conditions to reconsider:** Deliver the missing `aggregate_evidence_*`, `run_protocol_*_gates.py`, `validate_gate_*`, and governance reporting scripts; update the registry; and demonstrate automated execution through end-to-end scenario rehearsals.【b5f2c8†L18-L193】【b0f694†L24-L104】
