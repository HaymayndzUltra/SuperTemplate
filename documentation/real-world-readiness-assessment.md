## Readiness Scorecard

| Category | Weight | Score (/10) | Weighted |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Protocol Completeness | 25% | 6.6 | 1.65 |
| Script Integration | 20% | 2.0 | 0.40 |
| Quality Gates | 20% | 3.0 | 0.60 |
| Evidence Collection | 15% | 3.5 | 0.53 |
| Real-World Applicability | 20% | 4.5 | 0.90 |
| **Total** | **100%** | **5.0 / 10** | **5.08 / 10** |

Data derived from protocol scorecard and automation audits.【F:documentation/analysis-scorecard.json†L2-L30】【F:documentation/protocol-script-reference-report.md†L5-L38】

**Decision:** **NO-GO**. The workflow is not production ready; critical blockers remain in automation coverage and operational depth.

## Scenario Validation

### 1. Freelance Project (Upwork engagement)

- **Strengths:** Proposal, discovery, and brief creation protocols mirror freelance expectations with explicit communication checkpoints.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/01-client-proposal-generation.md†L36-L154】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/02-client-discovery-initiation.md†L33-L190】
- **Blockers:** Missing discovery validation scripts and approval automations eliminate enforceable gates, so the system cannot guarantee compliance with platform standards.【F:documentation/protocol-script-reference-report.md†L13-L24】
- **Verdict:** Fail – manual validation burden contradicts the “autonomous agent” objective.

### 2. Enterprise Software Delivery

- **Strengths:** Planning protocols articulate architecture rationale, compliance considerations, and risk registers expected by enterprise PMOs.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/07-technical-design-architecture.md†L33-L149】
- **Blockers:** Deployment, monitoring, and incident response protocols lack executable runbooks or integrations with enterprise tooling (CI/CD, observability, on-call), and referenced scripts are missing.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/15-production-deployment.md†L35-L170】【F:documentation/protocol-script-reference-report.md†L27-L35】
- **Verdict:** Fail – operations cannot be executed or audited.

### 3. Startup MVP Delivery

- **Strengths:** Task generation and execution workflows emphasise rapid iteration with evidence capture, aligning with fast-moving teams.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/08-generate-tasks.md†L37-L145】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/10-process-tasks.md†L37-L154】
- **Blockers:** Lack of change-request handling, automated testing hooks, and deployment pipelines prevent quick pivots and continuous delivery.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/10-process-tasks.md†L37-L154】【F:documentation/protocol-script-reference-report.md†L22-L35】
- **Verdict:** Fail – automation debt slows iteration.

## Go/No-Go Criteria Evaluation

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| All critical gaps resolved | ❌ | 160 missing scripts across protocols; automation backlog unresolved.【F:documentation/protocol-script-reference-report.md†L5-L38】 |
| Protocol completeness ≥ 90% | ❌ | Average completeness 6.6/10; numerous protocols rely on manual intervention.【F:documentation/analysis-scorecard.json†L2-L19】 |
| Script integration ≥ 85% | ❌ | Only 14% of scripts registered; majority unreferenced or missing.【F:documentation/script-inventory-report.md†L7-L21】 |
| Quality gates enforceable | ❌ | Gate runners absent for most protocols, preventing automated enforcement.【F:documentation/protocol-script-reference-report.md†L13-L35】 |
| Evidence collection complete | ❌ | Evidence manifests required but generator scripts absent.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/03-project-brief-creation.md†L39-L149】 |
| Real-world validation successful | ❌ | All three scenario simulations failed due to automation gaps.| 

**Decision:** **NO-GO** – defer production rollout until automation and operational playbooks are implemented.

## Critical Blockers

1. **Missing automation scripts (Blocker).** Prevents enforcement of nearly every quality gate.【F:documentation/protocol-script-reference-report.md†L5-L38】
2. **Operational runbooks absent (Blocker).** Deployment, monitoring, and incident workflows cannot be executed.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/15-production-deployment.md†L35-L170】
3. **Evidence generators missing (High).** Protocols mandate artefacts without tooling support, risking compliance gaps.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/03-project-brief-creation.md†L39-L149】

---

## High-Priority Actions

1. Implement discovery, brief, and task validation scripts; register them and add CI checks.【F:documentation/protocol-script-reference-report.md†L13-L24】【F:scripts/script-registry.json†L1-L23】
2. Deliver deployment and incident automation aligned with Protocols 15-17 (e.g., GitHub Actions, PagerDuty hooks).【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/15-production-deployment.md†L35-L170】
3. Build evidence generation CLI for mandated manifests (`project-brief-validation-report.json`, `execution-artifact-manifest.json`).【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/03-project-brief-creation.md†L39-L149】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/10-process-tasks.md†L67-L154】

## Implementation Timeline Recommendation

- **Week 0-2:** Address automation backlog for discovery, planning, and execution gates. Expand script registry and add CI validation.
- **Week 2-4:** Deliver operational runbooks and tooling (deployment pipelines, monitoring bootstrap, incident automation). Pilot in staging.
- **Week 4-6:** Implement evidence generators, integrate change-control workflows, and run full lifecycle simulation with automated gates.

Release is advised only after all blockers are closed and simulations pass end-to-end without manual intervention.
