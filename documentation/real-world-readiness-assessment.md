# Real-World Readiness Assessment

## Executive Summary
- **Current maturity:** The lifecycle framework is **not production ready**; protocols average 5.2/10 and realism remains the weakest dimension (3.2/10). 【f60a3e†L1-L24】【be33c7†L1-L24】
- **Automation gap:** Only 13 of 82 Python scripts are registered and 47 referenced validators are missing, preventing autonomous gate enforcement across every phase. 【d8c6a4†L1-L17】【99ddcb†L1-L21】
- **Scenario verdict:** All three target scenarios (freelance, enterprise, startup) fail due to absent change-control workflows, missing automation, and unimplemented compliance tooling.

## Readiness Scorecard
| Category | Weight | Score (0-10) | Weighted Score | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Protocol Completeness | 25% | 7.3 | 1.8 | Structured checklists but dependent on missing automation. 【be33c7†L1-L24】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/01-client-proposal-generation.md†L134-L168】 |
| Script Integration | 20% | 2.0 | 0.4 | Only 13 registered scripts; 47 references missing. 【d8c6a4†L1-L17】【99ddcb†L1-L21】 |
| Quality Gates | 20% | 2.0 | 0.4 | Gate runners and validators (`run_protocol_*_gates.py`, `validate_gate_*`) absent. 【edfa92†L9-L129】 |
| Evidence Collection | 15% | 4.0 | 0.6 | Protocols request detailed artifacts but lack aggregators (`aggregate_evidence_*.py`). 【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/08-generate-tasks.md†L126-L153】【edfa92†L9-L129】 |
| Real-World Applicability | 20% | 4.0 | 0.8 | Missing change-request governance; tooling assumes Cursor, HIPAA scripts absent. 【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/05-bootstrap-your-project.md†L37-L159】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/15-production-deployment.md†L160-L191】 |
| **Total** | **100%** |  | **4.0/10 – NO GO** |  |

## Scenario Testing
### 1. Freelance Project Simulation (Upwork-style engagement)
- **Discovery to proposal:** Protocols 01-03 cover tone, discovery forms, and briefs, but rely on absent validators (`validate_proposal_structure.py`, `validate_discovery_scope.py`, `verify_brief_approvals.py`). Client-ready gating cannot run. 【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/01-client-proposal-generation.md†L148-L167】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/02-client-discovery-initiation.md†L138-L164】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/03-project-brief-creation.md†L130-L149】
- **Bootstrap & tasking:** Cursor-governed bootstrap and rule migration block engagements that prohibit repository mutations or require alternative IDEs. Task generation depends on missing rule validators. 【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/05-bootstrap-your-project.md†L37-L159】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/08-generate-tasks.md†L126-L154】
- **Outcome:** Freelance delivery fails at gate execution; recommend adding manual review fallbacks and implementing validators before client-facing use.

### 2. Enterprise Software with Compliance Requirements
- **Compliance tooling gap:** HIPAA/SOC2 references exist (`check_hipaa.py`), but key monitoring, incident, and audit gates call scripts that do not exist (`validate_gate_12_assurance.py`, `validate_gate_13_mitigation.py`, `validate_gate_14_baseline.py`). 【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/16-monitoring-observability.md†L165-L186】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/17-incident-response-rollback.md†L167-L188】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/18-performance-optimization.md†L164-L185】
- **Multi-team coordination:** No explicit change-control or approval workflow for scope pivots; enterprise PMOs require CR logs and steering committee integration.
- **Outcome:** Enterprise deployment is **no-go** without automation for observability gates, incident drills, and change governance.

### 3. Startup MVP Iteration
- **Rapid iteration needs:** Heavy evidence requirements (multiple manifests per step) slow early-stage delivery, while validators such as `validate_task_decomposition.py` and `validate_environment_requirements.py` are missing. 【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/08-generate-tasks.md†L126-L146】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/09-environment-setup-validation.md†L123-L150】
- **Pivot handling:** No mechanism to log hypothesis changes or backlog reprioritization; startup teams need lightweight loops.
- **Outcome:** Without optional lightweight track and functioning automation, MVP acceleration goals cannot be met.

## Go/No-Go Decision
- **Decision:** **NO-GO** for production rollout.
- **Rationale:** Critical automation gaps, absent change control, and tooling lock-in violate minimum readiness standards. All weighted categories fall below 5/10, and scenario simulations fail.

## Critical Blockers
1. **Missing automation scripts (47 references):** Must implement or remove before relying on gate-driven workflows. 【99ddcb†L1-L21】
2. **Tooling lock-in:** Cursor-specific bootstrap and rule migration block standard IDE users. Provide alternative workflows or skip automation until generalized. 【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/05-bootstrap-your-project.md†L37-L159】
3. **Change-request governance:** Introduce a protocol for scope changes, waivers, and approvals to support iterative delivery.

## High-Priority Actions
- Build generic gate runner + evidence aggregator (blocks 1 & 2 of optimization plan). 【edfa92†L9-L129】
- Register all active scripts and document invocation/requirements for bootstrap, deployment, and monitoring stages. 【d8c6a4†L1-L17】【F:scripts/script-registry.json†L1-L19】
- Add manual fallback guidance for every validator until automation exists to maintain service continuity.

## Implementation Timeline (Suggested)

| Critical | Deliver change-request protocol & templates | Enables scope control | 24h | Week 1 |
| High | Register bootstrap/deployment scripts + docs | Improves governance transparency | 16h | Week 2 |
