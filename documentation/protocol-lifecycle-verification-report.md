# Protocol Lifecycle Verification Report

## Executive Summary
- **Overall score:** The protocol set averages **4.4/10** once five evaluation dimensions are summed per protocol, with Phase 0 scoring 6.08/10 and every downstream phase dropping below 4.0/10.【25d2fc†L1-L33】
- **Automation gap:** 19 of 23 core protocols reference prerequisite validators such as `aggregate_evidence_*`, `run_protocol_*_gates.py`, and bespoke quality gates that do not exist in the repository, leaving every phase dependent on manual intervention.【b5f2c8†L18-L149】
- **Quality gate fragility:** Even where mature tooling exists (e.g., `analyze_jobpost.py`, `doctor.py`, `generate_prd_assets.py`), required gate orchestration scripts are missing, preventing automated enforcement of the documented thresholds.【5906f2†L134-L167】【79179f†L153-L250】【b5f2c8†L18-L137】
- **Freelance alignment vs. execution:** Early-phase protocols mirror Upwork-style engagement, but downstream phases lack concrete change-management, deployment rehearsal, or maintenance automation, blocking production readiness for client projects.【8ba875†L138-L205】【b5f2c8†L110-L149】

## Methodology
1. Evaluated Protocols 01–23 individually across **Completeness, Realism, Clarity, Adaptability, and Freelance Alignment** (0–10 each), producing a 0–50 per-protocol score.【25d2fc†L1-L33】
2. Cross-referenced each required automation hook with the `/scripts` directory to confirm availability and maturity.【b5f2c8†L18-L149】【7c98f9†L1-L44】
3. Reviewed quality gates and evidence flows against real repository artifacts to determine enforceability.【5906f2†L134-L167】【8ba875†L138-L165】【a20ce7†L130-L205】
4. Aggregated findings into weighted lifecycle and readiness assessments (see Production Readiness section).

【25d2fc†L1-L33】

### Phase Trends
- **Phase 0 (Protocols 01–05):** 6.08/10 average. Strong client-aligned narratives with working scripts (`analyze_jobpost.py`, `tone_mapper.py`, `doctor.py`) but automated gates fail because prerequisite validators are missing (`aggregate_evidence_00A.py`, `validate_principles.py`, etc.).【5906f2†L134-L167】【5b16d5†L185-L211】【b5f2c8†L18-L71】
- **Phase 1-2 (Protocols 06–09):** 4.55/10 average. Planning artifacts have structured expectations yet depend on absent validators and gate runners (`run_protocol_1_gates.py`, `validate_prd_context.py`, `aggregate_evidence_7.py`).【a20ce7†L130-L205】【79179f†L153-L250】【b5f2c8†L72-L101】
- **Phase 3 (Protocols 10–11):** 4.0/10 average. Task execution assumes `update_task_state.py` exists, but other enforcement such as `validate_quality_gate.py` and `run_contract_tests.py` are missing, preventing credible E2E verification.【b5f2c8†L102-L117】
- **Phase 4 (Protocols 12–14):** 3.73/10 average. Quality audit, UAT, and staging protocols enumerate comprehensive gates yet have zero registered automation, leaving the entire phase manual despite expectations for static analysis and rehearsal tooling.【b5f2c8†L118-L133】
- **Phase 5 (Protocols 15–18):** 3.70/10 average. Deployment and operations workflows rely on nonexistent aggregate evidence, rollback orchestration, and monitoring validators, so production control cannot be automated.【b5f2c8†L134-L149】
- **Phase 6 (Protocols 19–23):** 3.72/10 average. Knowledge transfer, closure, maintenance, retrospectives, and script governance all call for audit artifacts and compliance checks without providing real tools to generate them.【b5f2c8†L150-L193】【b0f694†L1-L107】

## Phase-by-Phase Detail
### Phase 0 – Foundation & Discovery (Protocols 01–05)
- **Protocol 01** delivers a realistic freelance communication cadence and uses mature scripts (`analyze_jobpost.py`, `tone_mapper.py`, `validate_proposal.py`), but the gate sequence requires missing orchestration (`validate_proposal_structure.py`, `run_protocol_00A_gates.py`).【5906f2†L134-L167】【b5f2c8†L18-L25】 This limits automation to partial checks and forces manual confirmation before proceeding.
- **Protocol 02** formalizes discovery sign-off yet depends entirely on absent validators for objectives, scope, expectation alignment, and client confirmation, eliminating automated guardrails for the most critical client touchpoint.【8ba875†L136-L165】【b5f2c8†L26-L35】
- **Protocol 03** expects `validate_discovery_inputs.py`, `validate_brief_structure.py`, and `verify_brief_approvals.py` to certify PRD readiness, but none exist; approvals must therefore be tracked manually despite strict 0.95 thresholds.【a20ce7†L130-L205】【b5f2c8†L36-L44】
- **Protocols 04–05** integrate genuine tooling (`doctor.py`, `rules_audit_quick.py`, `normalize_project_rules.py`) but still reference missing prerequisite validators and scaffold checks, so the advertised CI automation cannot run.【79179f†L153-L250】【5b16d5†L185-L211】【b5f2c8†L45-L71】

### Phase 1-2 – Planning & Design (Protocols 06–09)
Planning documents and architecture flows are well-described yet have no working validation chain beyond `generate_prd_assets.py` and `validate_prd_gate.py`. All aggregate evidence scripts and gate runners cited in the protocols are absent, so acceptance criteria cannot be enforced programmatically.【a20ce7†L130-L205】【b5f2c8†L72-L101】 The environment validation phase similarly depends on nonexistent `package_environment_assets.py` and `run_protocol_7_gates.py`, leaving infrastructure readiness unchecked.【b5f2c8†L90-L101】

### Phase 3 – Development (Protocols 10–11)
Task execution provides structured evidence expectations but only `update_task_state.py` exists; all other gating utilities, including preflight, quality-gate verifiers, and integration test harnesses, are missing.【b5f2c8†L102-L117】 Consequently, change requests, regression validation, and artifact manifest generation remain theoretical.

### Phase 4 – Quality & Testing (Protocols 12–14)
Quality audit, UAT, and staging protocols demand multi-layer validation, static analysis, and deployment rehearsals, yet reference zero working scripts. Without `run_protocol_4_gates.py`, `build_uat_toolkit.py`, or staging automation, the 6-layer audit collapses into manual review, contradicting the “automation-first” positioning.【b5f2c8†L118-L133】

### Phase 5 – Deployment & Operations (Protocols 15–18)
Production deployment inherits `deploy_backend.sh`, but all supporting validation, freeze, rollback, and performance optimization scripts are missing. Monitoring relies solely on `collect_perf.py`; observability gating, incident response validation, and performance governance cannot execute.【b5f2c8†L134-L149】

### Phase 6 – Closure & Maintenance (Protocols 19–23)
Documentation, closure, maintenance, and retrospectives list detailed outputs but no automation. Protocol 23 expects inventories, documentation audits, static analysis suites, and remediation backlogs, yet none of the referenced scripts or artifact generators are present, blocking governance coverage.【b0f694†L1-L105】【b5f2c8†L150-L193】

## Cross-Protocol Integration Analysis
- **Prerequisite chaining:** Later phases rely on artifacts whose generation is not automated earlier (e.g., Protocol 04 expects `brief-validation-report.json`, Protocol 05 requires `template-inventory.md`), forcing manual artifact fabrication that breaks evidence integrity.【79179f†L153-L205】【5b16d5†L185-L214】
- **Automation registry:** Only 13 scripts are registered in `script-registry.json`, leaving the majority of referenced automation untracked and uninvokable by orchestrators.【e51091†L1-L20】【6c0539†L1-L7】
- **Evidence propagation:** Without `aggregate_evidence_*` families, the promised `.artifacts/protocol-*` hierarchies cannot be generated consistently, undermining end-to-end traceability.

## Gap Inventory
### Critical (Blockers)
1. **Missing gate orchestrators:** Every phase requires `run_protocol_*_gates.py` and `aggregate_evidence_*` scripts that do not exist, preventing the quality gates from running.【b5f2c8†L18-L149】
2. **Script governance tooling absent:** Protocol 23’s inventory, documentation, static analysis, and compliance scripts are missing, so automation governance cannot begin.【b0f694†L24-L104】【b5f2c8†L150-L193】

### High Priority (Severe Friction)
1. **Planning validation gap:** Protocols 06–09 specify context, requirement, and environment validators without implementation, forcing manual reviews for complex artifacts.【a20ce7†L130-L205】【b5f2c8†L72-L101】
2. **Testing harness deficit:** Development and integration testing expect preflight, contract testing, and manifest generators that are absent, blocking real-world QA.【b5f2c8†L102-L117】

### Medium Priority (Efficiency)
1. **Evidence aggregation backlog:** Lacking automated evidence collectors introduces redundant manual exports, slowing audits and retrospectives.【b5f2c8†L18-L193】
2. **Registry misalignment:** Many existing scripts (`doctor.py`, `rules_audit_quick.py`, `collect_perf.py`) are unregistered, reducing discoverability for orchestrators.【7c98f9†L1-L44】【e51091†L1-L20】

### Low Priority (Enhancements)
1. **Communication templates:** Status prompts are well-documented but could be parameterized once core automation stabilizes.【5906f2†L171-L180】【8ba875†L168-L205】
2. **Optional analytics:** Suggested metrics (readability ≥ 90, coverage ≥ 0.95) become meaningful only after validation scripts exist; these can be instrumented later.【5906f2†L134-L167】【8ba875†L138-L165】

## Production Readiness Scorecard
| Category | Weight | Score | Weighted Contribution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Protocol Completeness | 25% | 5.3 | 1.33 |
| Script Integration | 20% | 2.5 | 0.50 |
| Quality Gates | 20% | 3.0 | 0.60 |
| Evidence Collection | 15% | 4.0 | 0.60 |
| Real-World Applicability | 20% | 3.5 | 0.70 |
| **Total** | **100%** | **3.73 / 10** | **3.73** |
【3533a3†L1-L19】

**Decision:** The system is **NO-GO for production** until automation coverage and governance tooling are implemented. Manual execution contradicts the promised autonomous workflow and blocks client-facing reliability.
