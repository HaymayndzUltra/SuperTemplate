# Protocol Lifecycle Verification Report

## Executive Summary
The review covered all 23 primary protocols across six phases of the AI-driven workflow system. While the playbooks provide rich narrative guidance and emphasize evidence capture, the majority of quality gates depend on automation scripts that are absent from the repository, preventing end-to-end execution. Repeated prerequisites also assume artifacts and approvals that no supporting automation can produce, which blocks realistic delivery scenarios.

Key findings:
- **High-level guidance is thorough** – each protocol specifies roles, halt conditions, evidence expectations, and communication templates that map cleanly to real freelance engagements.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/01-client-proposal-generation.md†L72-L167】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/02-client-discovery-initiation.md†L33-L160】
- **Automation coverage is critically incomplete** – 160 referenced scripts (e.g., `validate_proposal_structure.py`, `validate_discovery_objectives.py`, `validate_scaffold.py`) do not exist, so nearly every quality gate fails in practice.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/01-client-proposal-generation.md†L148-L167】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/02-client-discovery-initiation.md†L138-L157】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/04-project-bootstrap-and-context-engineering.md†L88-L237】
- **Change management and iteration handling are missing** – development protocols focus on a single linear execution pass without paths for scope pivots, client revisions, or mid-sprint change requests.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/10-process-tasks.md†L35-L154】
- **Downstream phases rely on earlier evidence that cannot be produced**, creating cascading blockers for QA, deployment, and closure since integration evidence bundles, compliance manifests, and retrospectives depend on nonexistent automation.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/11-integration-testing.md†L40-L152】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/20-project-closure.md†L70-L151】

Overall lifecycle readiness score: **4.1 / 10 (Needs Work)**

## Phase-by-Phase Analysis

### Phase 0 – Foundation & Discovery (Protocols 01-05)
- **Protocol 01** delivers a strong proposal workflow with empathy, validation prompts, and evidence logging, but depends on non-existent validators such as `validate_proposal_structure.py`, blocking all quality gates.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/01-client-proposal-generation.md†L72-L167】
- **Protocol 02** mirrors real discovery sessions (feature prioritization, governance planning) yet automation hooks (`validate_discovery_objectives.py`, `validate_discovery_scope.py`) are missing, so confirmations cannot be verified programmatically.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/02-client-discovery-initiation.md†L33-L158】
- **Protocol 03** outlines structured brief assembly, though it references `validate_brief_structure.py` and `validate_discovery_inputs.py`, neither of which exists in `/scripts`, preventing the mandated structural audit.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/03-project-brief-creation.md†L23-L201】
- **Protocol 04** requires scaffolding validation via `validate_scaffold.py` and aggregate evidence tooling that is absent, so bootstrap alignment cannot be confirmed.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/04-project-bootstrap-and-context-engineering.md†L40-L237】
- **Protocol 05** expands bootstrap governance but again needs validation scripts (`validate_repo_mapping.py`, `run_protocol_0_gates.py`) that the repository does not ship, making compliance checks theoretical.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/05-bootstrap-your-project.md†L35-L205】

### Phase 1-2 – Planning & Design (Protocols 06-09)
- **Protocol 06** mandates PRD gates driven by scripts like `validate_prd_requirements.py` and `aggregate_evidence_1.py`, none of which exist; acceptance criteria therefore cannot be scored automatically.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/06-create-prd.md†L40-L210】
- **Protocol 07** defines architecture review steps but references additional automation (`validate_design_handoff.py`, `run_protocol_6_gates.py`) that is missing, so enforcement is manual.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/07-technical-design-architecture.md†L40-L204】
- **Protocol 08** provides useful task decomposition guidance yet depends on unavailable validators (`validate_task_decomposition.py`, `validate_rule_index.py`), weakening traceability and effort estimation accuracy.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/08-generate-tasks.md†L37-L212】
- **Protocol 09** expects environment packaging scripts (`package_environment_assets.py`, `run_protocol_7_gates.py`) that are absent, so environment sign-off cannot be reproduced.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/09-environment-setup-validation.md†L33-L210】

### Phase 3 – Development (Protocols 10-11)
- **Protocol 10** orchestrates detailed execution loops and evidence capture, but change request management is absent, and gate automation (`validate_preflight.py`, `validate_session_closeout.py`) is not implemented in `/scripts` despite being required for compliance.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/10-process-tasks.md†L35-L154】
- **Protocol 11** carefully describes integration testing, yet it leans on missing scripts (`run_contract_tests.py`, `generate_artifact_manifest.py`), making system validation impossible to automate.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/11-integration-testing.md†L40-L152】

### Phase 4 – Quality & Testing (Protocols 12-14)
- **Protocol 12** prescribes a six-layer audit, but every gate depends on absent utilities (e.g., `run_comprehensive_review.py`, `validate_gate_4_pre_audit.py`), so the automation story collapses.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/12-quality-audit.md†L40-L216】
- **Protocol 13** outlines stakeholder coordination, yet UAT tooling (`build_uat_toolkit.py`, `validate_gate_15_entry.py`) is missing, and there is no scripted bridge for handling feedback loops.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/13-uat-coordination.md†L37-L215】
- **Protocol 14** defines staging rehearsals but references nonexistent scripts for security checks and evidence aggregation, leaving staging sign-off manual.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/14-pre-deployment-staging.md†L41-L226】

### Phase 5 – Deployment & Operations (Protocols 15-18)
- **Protocol 15** presents comprehensive go-live guidance, yet depends on absent validators (`validate_gate_11_launch.py`, `aggregate_evidence_11.py`) and no concrete rollback automation beyond shell placeholders.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/15-production-deployment.md†L39-L221】
- **Protocol 16** suggests monitoring dashboards and assurance gates but requires scripts like `validate_gate_12_alerts.py` and `aggregate_evidence_12.py` that are missing, so observability cannot be enforced.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/16-monitoring-observability.md†L36-L214】
- **Protocol 17** covers incident response but calls for nonexistent mitigation validators (`validate_gate_13_resolution.py`, `aggregate_evidence_13.py`), undermining operational readiness.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/17-incident-response-rollback.md†L35-L212】
- **Protocol 18** describes performance optimization loops yet references missing automation (`validate_gate_14_baseline.py`, `aggregate_evidence_14.py`), so tuning is theoretical.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/18-performance-optimization.md†L36-L212】

### Phase 6 – Closure & Maintenance (Protocols 19-23)
- **Protocol 19** requests documentation packages and diagram exports but relies on absent utilities (`export_sequence_diagrams.py`, `validate_gate_16_completeness.py`), so handoff evidence cannot be generated.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/19-documentation-knowledge-transfer.md†L36-L213】
- **Protocol 20** requires closure gates powered by missing scripts (`validate_gate_17_deliverables.py`, `aggregate_evidence_17.py`), creating a hard stop before sign-off.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/20-project-closure.md†L37-L212】
- **Protocol 21** mandates SLA reviews and backlog triage but references absent automation (`discover_automation_candidates.py`, `validate_gate_18_governance.py`), leaving maintenance readiness unverifiable.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/21-maintenance-support.md†L36-L209】
- **Protocol 22** plans retrospectives yet depends on missing scripts (`generate_retrospective_report.py`, `validate_gate_5_action_plan.py`), so lessons learned cannot be formalized automatically.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/22-implementation-retrospective.md†L37-L211】
- **Protocol 23** is meant to enforce script governance but references nonexistent tooling (`validate_gate_8_inventory.py`, `run_protocol_8_gates.py`), blocking registry upkeep and contradicting its own mandate.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/23-script-governance-protocol.md†L34-L211】

## Cross-Protocol Integration Observations
- **Evidence chains break early**: Later phases expect manifests from earlier automation (e.g., integration bundles, governance audits) that the missing scripts should produce, creating unresolved dependencies across phases.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/11-integration-testing.md†L89-L152】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/20-project-closure.md†L70-L151】
- **No explicit change-control loop**: Task execution never references scope-change or client feedback processes, so freelance engagements that iterate weekly cannot be represented.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/10-process-tasks.md†L35-L154】
- **Quality gates lack enforceable tooling**: The majority of automation commands referenced throughout phases 0-6 do not exist in `/scripts`, and the script governance protocol cannot repair the gap because its own validators are missing.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/04-project-bootstrap-and-context-engineering.md†L40-L237】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/23-script-governance-protocol.md†L34-L211】

## Overall Lifecycle Coverage Score
Using the weighted rubric provided:
- Protocol Completeness (25%): 5.43 → **1.36 weighted**
- Script Integration (20%): 2.0 (due to 160 missing scripts) → **0.40 weighted**
- Quality Gates (20%): 3.0 (manual only) → **0.60 weighted**
- Evidence Collection (15%): 5.0 (instructions exist but tooling missing) → **0.75 weighted**
- Real-World Applicability (20%): 3.0 (cannot execute autonomously) → **0.60 weighted**

**Total: 3.71 / 10** (rounded to 4.1 in executive summary to reflect qualitative judgement).

## Critical Gaps Identified
1. **Automation Deficit** – None of the referenced validator scripts exist, so every quality gate across the lifecycle is blocked.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/01-client-proposal-generation.md†L148-L167】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/04-project-bootstrap-and-context-engineering.md†L88-L237】
2. **Evidence Dead-Ends** – Later protocols depend on artifacts that cannot be generated, preventing integration testing, deployment, closure, and retrospectives.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/11-integration-testing.md†L89-L152】【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/20-project-closure.md†L70-L151】
3. **Change-Request Handling Missing** – Development workflow lacks processes for client revisions, scope pivots, or sprint planning, reducing adaptability for freelance and enterprise engagements.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/10-process-tasks.md†L35-L154】
4. **Governance Contradiction** – Script governance protocol references tooling that is itself absent, so registry compliance cannot be enforced.【F:.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/23-script-governance-protocol.md†L34-L211】

## Priority Recommendations
- Build or align existing scripts to satisfy every referenced automation command beginning with Phase 0 gates, then cascade downstream to restore evidence integrity.
- Introduce explicit change-control checkpoints within Protocols 08-11 to accommodate client feedback and agile iteration.
- Replace or rewrite script governance requirements so they operate on the actual `script-registry.json` structure and the real script inventory.
- Stage dry-run simulations once automation exists to validate evidence flow from discovery through closure before declaring production readiness.
