# Protocol Cycle Resolution Analysis

## Date: 2025-10-30
## Author: Meta-Architecture Implementation Specialist
## Purpose: Document root cause and resolution for 8 detected cycle patterns

---

## Detected Cycles (From Causal Replay)

### Cycle Group 1: Phase 0 Discovery Loops

#### Cycle 1.1: P02→P03→P04→P05→P02
**Pattern**: Client Discovery → Brief → Bootstrap → Legacy Align → back to Discovery

**Root Cause**: P05 (Bootstrap Your Project) has `outputs_to: ["02", "24"]`
- This creates a feedback loop from bootstrapping back to client discovery
- Architecturally invalid: Once bootstrap is complete, project moves forward to PRD (P06)

**Resolution**: Remove P02 from P05's outputs_to
- **Before**: `outputs_to: ["02", "24"]`
- **After**: `outputs_to: ["24"]` (only alternate track, if needed)
- **Better**: `outputs_to: ["06"]` (move forward to PRD Creation)

#### Cycle 1.2: P03→P04→P05→P24→P03
**Pattern**: Brief → Bootstrap → Legacy Align → Alternate Discovery → back to Brief

**Root Cause**: P05 outputs to P24, and P24 outputs back to P03
- P24 (Alternate Discovery) has `outputs_to: ["03", "06"]`
- This creates cycle: P03→P04→P05→P24→P03

**Resolution**: P24 should only output forward, not back to P03
- **Before**: P24 `outputs_to: ["03", "06"]`
- **After**: P24 `outputs_to: ["06"]` (direct to PRD, skip brief regeneration)

### Cycle Group 2: Phase 6 Closure/Maintenance Loops

#### Cycle 2.1: P12→P20→P21→P22→P23→P12
**Pattern**: Quality Audit → Closure → Maintenance → Retrospective → Script Governance → back to Quality Audit

**Root Cause**: P23 (Script Governance) has `outputs_to: ["12", "22", "19"]`
- Creates cycle back to P12 (Quality Audit)
- Architecturally questionable: Script governance findings shouldn't loop back to quality audit

**Resolution**: Remove P12 from P23's outputs_to
- **Before**: `outputs_to: ["12", "22", "19"]`
- **After**: `outputs_to: ["22", "19"]` (feedback to retrospective and docs only)

#### Cycle 2.2: P22→P23→P22
**Pattern**: Retrospective → Script Governance → back to Retrospective

**Root Cause**: Bidirectional dependency P22↔P23
- P22 outputs to P23
- P23 outputs back to P22
- Creates direct 2-node cycle

**Resolution**: Remove P22 from P23's outputs_to
- P23 should output to P19 (documentation) but NOT back to P22
- **Before**: `outputs_to: ["12", "22", "19"]`
- **After**: `outputs_to: ["19"]` (governance findings update docs only)

#### Cycle 2.3: P20→P21→P22→P23→P19→P20
**Pattern**: Closure → Maintenance → Retrospective → Governance → Documentation → back to Closure

**Root Cause**: P19 (Documentation) has `outputs_to: ["20", "21", "22"]`
- Creates cycle when P20 is in the output list
- P20 (Closure) should be final, not receive feedback from P19

**Resolution**: Remove P20 from P19's outputs_to
- **Before**: `outputs_to: ["20", "21", "22"]`
- **After**: `outputs_to: ["21", "22"]` (docs feed maintenance and retrospective only)

#### Cycle 2.4: P21→P22→P23→P19→P21
**Pattern**: Maintenance → Retrospective → Governance → Documentation → back to Maintenance

**Root Cause**: P19 outputs to P21, creating feedback loop
- Similar to Cycle 2.3

**Resolution**: Already fixed by removing P21 from P19's outputs_to (if needed)
- P19 should output to P22 (retrospective) for lessons learned
- Not back to P21 (maintenance planning)

#### Cycle 2.5: P22→P23→P19→P22
**Pattern**: Retrospective → Governance → Documentation → back to Retrospective

**Root Cause**: P19 outputs to P22, and P23 outputs to P19, creating triangle
- P22→P23→P19→P22

**Resolution**: Already addressed by fixing P23's outputs

### Cycle Group 3: Mega Loop

#### Cycle 3.1: P06→...→P22→P06
**Pattern**: PRD Creation → [many protocols] → Retrospective → back to PRD

**Root Cause**: P22 (Retrospective) has `outputs_to: ["23", "06", "CI Backlog"]`
- P22 outputs back to P06 (PRD Creation)
- Creates potential mega-loop through entire development lifecycle

**Resolution**: Remove P06 from P22's outputs_to
- Retrospective should feed CI Backlog for future projects, not loop back to current PRD
- **Before**: `outputs_to: ["23", "06", "CI Backlog"]`
- **After**: `outputs_to: ["23", "CI Backlog"]` (governance and backlog only)

## Summary of Fixes

| Protocol | Current outputs_to | Fixed outputs_to | Reason |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|---------|
| P05 | ["02", "24"] | ["06"] | Remove backward loop to P02; move forward to PRD |
| P19 | ["20", "21", "22"] | ["21", "22"] | Remove P20 to prevent closure loop |
| P22 | ["23", "06", "CI Backlog"] | ["23", "CI Backlog"] | Remove P06 to prevent mega-loop |
| P23 | ["12", "22", "19"] | ["19"] | Remove P12 and P22 to prevent multiple loops |
| P24 | ["03", "06"] | ["06"] | Remove P03 to prevent brief regeneration loop |

## Validation Plan

After applying fixes:
1. Update `.artifacts/meta-upgrades/catalog/protocol_catalog.json`
2. Re-run causal replay simulation
3. Verify cycle detection = 0
4. Update `pop-activation-check.json` cycle_detection status
5. Document validation results

## Architectural Notes

### Forward-Only Flow Principle
Protocols should follow a forward-only flow through phases:
- Phase 0: Discovery & Setup (P01-P05)
- Phase 1-2: Planning (P06-P09)
- Phase 3: Development (P10-P11)
- Phase 4: Quality (P12-P14)
- Phase 5: Deployment (P15-P18)
- Phase 6: Closure (P19-P23)

### Feedback Mechanisms (Non-Cyclical)
Legitimate feedback should go to:
- **Backlog systems** (CI Backlog, Ops Teams, PMO Archive)
- **Future projects** (not current protocol execution)
- **Documentation** (P19) for lessons learned
- **Maintenance** (P21) for ongoing operations

### Cycle Prevention Rules
1. **No backward phase jumps**: P06+ should never output to P01-P05
2. **No sibling loops**: Adjacent protocols should not create bidirectional dependencies
3. **Closure is final**: P20 (Closure) should not receive protocol outputs after closure
4. **Governance observes, doesn't loop**: P23 should feed documentation, not execution protocols

## Impact Assessment

### Removed Handoffs:
- P05→P02: Eliminated (unnecessary discovery re-entry)
- P19→P20: Eliminated (closure is final)
- P22→P06: Eliminated (retrospective shouldn't regenerate PRD)
- P23→P12: Eliminated (governance findings to docs, not audit)
- P23→P22: Eliminated (governance to docs, not back to retrospective)
- P24→P03: Eliminated (alternate track goes directly to PRD)

### Preserved Handoffs:
- All forward-phase progressions maintained
- Legitimate feedback to CI Backlog, Ops Teams, PMO Archive
- Documentation and retrospective connections maintained where non-cyclical
