# Protocol Validation Report Comparison (PRs #56, #57, #58, #59)

## Methodology
- Downloaded the patch artifacts for PRs #56, #57, #58, and #59 and parsed their lone file `protocol-validation-verification-report.md` for manual review.
- Cross-referenced each claim against repository sources: `validation-summary.md`, `.cursor/commands/find-missing.md`, `dependency-map.mermaid`, `protocol-inventory.json`, and the protocol markdown files in `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/`.
- Spot-checked 10 evidence citations drawn from `.cursor/commands/find-missing.md` to verify file existence and relevance; logged additional invalid citations when encountered.
- Used command output (e.g., `grep` searches) to confirm absence of required evidence references inside the PR reports.

## 1. Completeness Component Check
Required components: (a) protocol inventory enumerating Protocols 01-23, (b) dependency mapping of relationships, (c) gap analysis with evidence citations, (d) SDLC coverage assessment, (e) severity classification, (f) remediation recommendations with effort estimates.

| Component | PR #56 | PR #57 | PR #58 | PR #59 | Notes |
|-----------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|-------|
| Protocol inventory (01-23 enumerated) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | None of the reports reproduces the protocol list; each only states aggregate counts such as “28 protocols” or “23 mainline protocols”. |
| Dependency mapping (relationships rendered) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | No PR embeds or links to a dependency diagram/table; all rely on narrative comments about `dependency-map.mermaid`. |
| Gap analysis with evidence citations (.cursor/...:line) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | `grep` against each report shows zero `.cursor/…` references, so no evidence citations were supplied.【13b4b0†L1-L2】【5fc0cd†L1-L2】【34064f†L1-L2】【f87f5a†L1-L2】 |
| SDLC coverage assessment | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Each report includes “Step 9: SDLC Coverage” noting phase coverage (e.g., PR #56: “All phases covered: Yes – Client Discovery through Closure mapped to protocols”). |
| Severity classification | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | All reports discuss severity totals in “Step 5: Severity Consistency”. |
| Remediation recommendations **with effort estimates** | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | Recommendations are present but lack effort qualifiers (no sizing, timeline, or prioritised effort level). |

**Result:** Every PR satisfies only 2/6 required components (<4 ⇒ score 0/30 for completeness).

## 2. Evidence Quality Verification

| PR | Reporter Claim | Actual Validation Result | Evidence Validity | Invalid Citation(s) |
|----|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| #56 | “Total citations checked: 23; Invalid citations: 0” | `.cursor/commands/find-missing.md` entry “Standard Workflow Missing Coverage” cites only the task description instead of a repository file, making the evidence unverifiable.【fe8c53†L187-L192】 | 0 % (0/1 invalids caught) | `.cursor/commands/find-missing.md` ¶“Standard Workflow Missing Coverage” |
| #57 | “Invalid citations: 1 (Standard Workflow Missing Coverage)” | Same invalid citation identified; remaining sampled references resolve correctly (10/10 spot-checks).【1ed81c†L1-L10】【7ff12f†L1-L10】【fda951†L1-L8】【68e4df†L1-L8】【13c539†L1-L8】【086f08†L1-L8】【1b09b8†L1-L12】【8534f9†L1-L11】【d2e29b†L1-L10】【2dc09b†L1-L10】 | 95 % (22/23 valid) | `.cursor/commands/find-missing.md` ¶“Standard Workflow Missing Coverage” |
| #58 | “Invalid citations: 0” | Same invalid citation left unflagged.【fe8c53†L187-L192】 | 0 % | `.cursor/commands/find-missing.md` ¶“Standard Workflow Missing Coverage” |
| #59 | “Invalid citations: 0” | Same invalid citation left unflagged.【fe8c53†L187-L192】 | 0 % | `.cursor/commands/find-missing.md` ¶“Standard Workflow Missing Coverage” |

> **Disqualification rule:** PRs #56, #58, and #59 fail the ≥60 % evidence-validity requirement and are therefore non-recommendable regardless of other scores.

## 3. Gap Count Accuracy Review
Baseline: `validation-summary.md` reports 21 gaps with severity split (CRITICAL 5, HIGH 4, MEDIUM 9, LOW 3).【23fcd6†L36-L63】【bda4a3†L217-L229】 Counting per-gap severities in `.cursor/commands/find-missing.md` yields 5 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH, 9 MEDIUM, 4 LOW【0f7d5b†L1-L1】【f2f591†L1-L1】【4f6b85†L1-L1】【510cd3†L1-L1】, revealing the documented mismatch.

| PR | Reported Totals | Identified Discrepancies | Accuracy Score |
|----|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| #56 | Totals = 21 in both files; asserts CRITICAL count mismatch (claims summary shows 4) and highlights HIGH/LOW divergences. | Correctly notes HIGH/LOW mismatches but incorrectly states the summary shows only four CRITICAL gaps (the summary states five).【2ae464†L20-L41】 | 15/20 |
| #57 | Totals = 21; correctly lists actual severity split (5/3/9/4) and flags HIGH/LOW inconsistencies. | No counting errors detected. | 20/20 |
| #58 | Totals = 21; flags severity table contradictions including P11 handoff downgraded to HIGH and LOW totals mismatch. | All observations align with source files.【23fcd6†L36-L44】【bda4a3†L217-L223】 | 20/20 |
| #59 | Totals = 21; highlights CRITICAL/HIGH/LOW divergences. | All observations align with source files.【23fcd6†L36-L44】【bda4a3†L217-L223】 | 20/20 |

## 4. Circular Dependency Logic Verification
Key ground truth excerpts:
- P11 prerequisites reference Protocol 21 artifacts but **not** Protocol 19.【5b4623†L13-L18】
- P14 prerequisites depend on Protocol 20 artifacts (future phase) alongside Protocols 15 and 19.【685df6†L13-L23】
- P15 prerequisites require Protocol 21 readiness assets.【6375e3†L13-L18】
- P19 prerequisites include self-references and future-phase artifacts.【d6d394†L13-L23】
- P21 prerequisites include self-referential artifacts (`PERFORMANCE-IMPROVEMENT-BACKLOG.json`, `TECH-DEBT-REGISTER.md`).【1dcb96†L13-L22】

| PR | Circular Dependency Verdict | Issues Found | Score |
|----|-----------------------------|--------------|-------|
| #56 | “Verified claims: 7/7 … Incorrect claims: 0/7” | Failed to catch overstated cycle P11→P19 and missing P14→P20 dependency. | 10/15 |
| #57 | Same as #56 | Same omissions as #56. | 10/15 |
| #58 | “Verified: 5/7; Incorrect: 2/7” | Correctly flags the overstated P11→P19 claim and the omitted P14→P20 dependency. | 15/15 |
| #59 | “Verified: 5/7; Incorrect: 2/7” | Same correct flags as #58. | 15/15 |

## 5. Internal Consistency Review
Criteria: protocol counts align across reported sections, severity messaging consistent, dependency assertions match source artefacts.

| PR | Consistency Observations | Score |
|----|-------------------------|-------|
| #56 | Mixes accurate (HIGH/LOW mismatches) and inaccurate (summary lists 5 CRITICAL gaps, not 4) statements, undermining internal alignment. | 5/10 |
| #57 | Declares dependency map aligned with inventory despite missing edges for P12–P15; fails to recognise cross-file inconsistency. | 5/10 |
| #58 | Generally consistent but Step 3 erroneously states the map “flags Protocol 21” for P14 despite the edge being absent.【13e95f†L68-L73】 | 5/10 |
| #59 | Internal statements align (identifies missing edges, severity mismatches, new gaps) without contradiction. | 10/10 |

## 6. Gap Comparison Snapshot

| Item | PR #56 | PR #57 | PR #58 | PR #59 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| New gaps reported in Step 8 | 3 (P21 self-dependency, P19 self-reference, P23 handoff typo) | 0 | 1 (P23 handoff mismatch) | 2 (P14→P20 dependency, P19 self/future dependencies) |
| Additional circularity issues spotted | None | None | P11 overstated; P14 missing P20 | P11 overstated; P14 missing P20 |
| Severity reconciliation offered | Partial (misstates CRITICAL counts) | Accurate (5/3/9/4) | Accurate | Accurate |

## 7. Dependency Validation Summary

| Dependency Claim | Actual Status | Correctly Flagged By |
|------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| P11 prerequisites require Protocol 21 **only** (no Protocol 19) | Overstated in original gap list | PR #58, PR #59 |
| P14 prerequisites require Protocol 20 (future phase) | Omitted in original gap list | PR #58, PR #59 |
| P19 prerequisites include self-references | Missing from gap list | PR #56, PR #59 |
| P21 prerequisites include self-references | Missing from gap list | PR #56 |

## 8. Scorecard

| Criterion | Weight | PR #56 | PR #57 | PR #58 | PR #59 |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Completeness | 30 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Evidence Quality | 25 | 0 | 25 | 0 | 0 |
| Gap Count Accuracy | 20 | 15 | 20 | 20 | 20 |
| Dependency Logic | 15 | 10 | 10 | 15 | 15 |
| Internal Consistency | 10 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| **TOTAL** | 100 | **30** | **60** | **40** | **45** |

> **Ranking:** PR #57 (60) > PR #59 (45) > PR #58 (40) > PR #56 (30). Tie-breaker not required. PRs #56, #58, #59 fail the ≥60 % evidence validity threshold and are automatically disqualified.

## 9. Recommendation
- **Recommended PR:** #57 — **Total Score 60/100** (meets evidence validity threshold, highest aggregate score).
- **Strengths:**
  1. Accurately identifies the lone invalid citation in the evidence package while confirming other references.【fe8c53†L187-L192】
  2. Provides correct severity reconciliation (5 CRITICAL / 3 HIGH / 9 MEDIUM / 4 LOW) consistent with per-gap annotations.【bda4a3†L217-L229】
  3. Supplies dependable totals and SDLC coverage assessment without contradicting underlying artefacts.【23fcd6†L36-L63】
- **Concerns with other PRs:**
  - **PR #56:** Misses the invalid citation and misstates critical severity counts (claims only four).【2ae464†L20-L41】
  - **PR #58:** Misses the invalid citation and repeats an incorrect dependency-map description for Protocol 14.【13e95f†L68-L73】
  - **PR #59:** Misses the invalid citation; otherwise strong but disqualified by evidence-validity rule.【fe8c53†L187-L192】
- **Confidence Level:** Medium — Evidence sampling confirms the reported strengths/weaknesses, but dependency-map inconsistencies across all PRs suggest further review when updated artefacts become available.

## 10. Implementation Plan & Acceptance Criteria

1. **Restore Evidence Compliance**
   - Replace the non-file citation in `.cursor/commands/find-missing.md` (“Standard Workflow Missing Coverage”) with a verifiable artefact path or mark the gap as unverifiable pending documentation update.【fe8c53†L187-L192】
   - Acceptance: evidence section references an actual repository file with valid line range.

2. **Correct Circular Dependency Catalogue**
   - Amend the gap list to reflect actual prerequisites: remove P11→P19, add P14→P20, and capture P19/P21 self-references.【5b4623†L13-L18】【685df6†L13-L18】【d6d394†L13-L23】【1dcb96†L13-L22】
   - Acceptance: gap summary tallies match corrected per-gap entries (5 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH, 9 MEDIUM, 4 LOW), and dependency-map edges align with updated prerequisites.

3. **Augment Verification Reports**
   - Require future verification reports to embed (a) a protocol inventory table, (b) dependency matrix extract, (c) explicit evidence citation checklist with pass/fail results, and (d) remediation recommendations tagged with estimated effort (e.g., S/M/L).
   - Acceptance: next verification report includes all six completeness components and lists evidence checks with ≥90 % validity rate based on independent sampling.
