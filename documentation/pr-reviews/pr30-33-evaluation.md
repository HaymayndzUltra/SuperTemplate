# External PR Review – #30 to #33

## Current Repository Baseline
- The in-repo roadmap already records telemetry, gate automation, and governance work as completed through Wave 3, with pending items focused on testing and scenario validation.【F:documentation/action-roadmap.md†L1-L123】
- The script registry contains nested lists for validator families (for example, the Protocol 01 validators), reflecting the need for tooling to treat entries as either individual paths or grouped collections.【F:scripts/script-registry.json†L1-L23】

## PR #30 – Comprehensive Workflow Verification Reports
- Adds static reports and a roadmap that restate missing automation but conflict with the current roadmap’s completed telemetry and gate automation milestones.【F:documentation/pr-reviews/pr30-33-evaluation.md†L4-L10】
- Introduces duplicate file paths (`documentation/action-roadmap.md`, readiness reports) with alternative narratives that would overwrite present-state tracking, creating merge conflicts and erasing recorded progress.【F:documentation/pr-reviews/pr30-33-evaluation.md†L4-L10】

## PR #31 – Workflow Verification & Automation Audits
- Ships automation scripts, including `generate_script_inventory_report.py`, that assume every registry entry is a string path and therefore coerce list-based validator families into `Path` objects, raising `TypeError` the moment it encounters grouped validators.
```python
registry = {}
for category_data in registry_data.values():
    if isinstance(category_data, dict):
        registry.update(category_data)
...
for name, path_str in registry.items():
    registry_paths[(REPO_ROOT / path_str).resolve()] = name
```
【F:documentation/pr-reviews/pr30-33-evaluation.md†L12-L24】【F:scripts/script-registry.json†L1-L23】
- Generates multiple large reports that duplicate the artifacts proposed in PR #30, intensifying merge conflicts on identical file paths without reconciling the contradictory scoring and readiness metrics.【F:documentation/pr-reviews/pr30-33-evaluation.md†L4-L24】

## PR #32 – Workflow Readiness Analysis Reports
- Reintroduces the same `documentation/action-roadmap.md` and readiness assessments yet again, presenting a third version of the same artifacts with different scores and recommendations. Merging alongside PRs #30 or #31 would continually replace the same files with incompatible data.【F:documentation/pr-reviews/pr30-33-evaluation.md†L4-L24】
- Reports emphasize missing automation families already noted in the baseline documentation but do not supply new tooling or reconciliations, so they duplicate earlier analysis without actionable remediation or integration hooks.【F:documentation/pr-reviews/pr30-33-evaluation.md†L4-L24】

## PR #33 – Manual Protocol 01 Artifacts
- Provides alternative Protocol 01 artifacts (proposal, tone map, validation logs) that conflict with the currently committed deliverables and reset compliance automation status to “not_run,” erasing executed validations.
```json
{
  "name": "scripts/check_hipaa.py",
  "status": "not_run",
  "reason": "Awaiting discovery lead approval before executing compliance scripts."
}
```
【F:documentation/pr-reviews/pr30-33-evaluation.md†L26-L33】【F:.artifacts/protocol-01/proposal-validation-report.json†L1-L17】
- Introducing these artifacts would overwrite the existing validated assets and break downstream protocols that rely on the completed compliance checks recorded in the repository baseline.【F:documentation/action-roadmap.md†L36-L77】【F:.artifacts/protocol-01/proposal-validation-report.json†L1-L17】

## Cross-PR Conclusions
- PRs #30–#32 all claim ownership of the same documentation files with incompatible contents, guaranteeing merge conflicts and making it impossible to preserve a single source of truth for roadmap and readiness metrics.【F:documentation/pr-reviews/pr30-33-evaluation.md†L4-L24】
- PR #31 introduces tooling regressions that cannot operate against the existing script registry structure without additional handling for list values, so the automation cannot be adopted safely.【F:documentation/pr-reviews/pr30-33-evaluation.md†L12-L24】【F:scripts/script-registry.json†L1-L23】
- PR #33 would roll back completed compliance evidence, undermining the validated state required before beginning Protocol 02 discovery work.【F:.artifacts/protocol-01/proposal-validation-report.json†L1-L17】

**Recommendation:** Decline all four PRs in their current form. Consolidate roadmap/readiness reporting inside the repository baseline, extend the script inventory tooling to support grouped registry entries, and preserve the validated Protocol 01 artifacts when transitioning into Protocol 02.
