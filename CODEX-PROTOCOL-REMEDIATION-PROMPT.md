# CODEX PROTOCOL REMEDIATION PROMPT
## Perfect 10/10 Execution Instructions

---

## üéØ MISSION STATEMENT

**Objective**: Remediate 27 AI-driven workflow protocols (excluding `00-generate-rules.md`) to achieve **10/10** across all quality metrics:
- **Completeness**: 10/10
- **Clarity**: 10/10
- **Actionability**: 10/10
- **Integration**: 10/10
- **Evidence**: 10/10
- **Automation**: 10/10

**Constraint**: You have complete autonomy to fix structural deficiencies, add missing sections, and establish complete integration mappings. The user will handle `00-generate-rules.md` separately.

```

---

### **[STRICT]** INTEGRATION MAPPING RULES

For every protocol, you **MUST**:

1. **Identify Upstream Dependencies:**
   - Read the 4 audit reports in `@report.md`
   - Identify which protocols provide inputs
   - Document exact artifact names and locations

2. **Define Downstream Consumers:**
   - Identify which protocols consume outputs
   - Create explicit output manifests
   - Ensure artifact naming consistency

3. **Validate Integration Chain:**
   - Ensure every input artifact is produced by an upstream protocol
   - Ensure every output artifact is consumed by a downstream protocol
   - Flag orphaned artifacts or missing connections

4. **Cross-Reference Validation:**
   - If Protocol X claims to output `artifact.json` to Protocol Y
   - Protocol Y **MUST** list `artifact.json` in its Prerequisites section
   - Both protocols **MUST** reference the same file path

---

### **[STRICT]** QUALITY GATE REQUIREMENTS

Every quality gate **MUST**:

1. **Have Measurable Criteria:**
   - ‚ùå BAD: "Code quality is good"
   - ‚úÖ GOOD: "Linter score ‚â• 8.5/10, zero critical violations"

2. **Define Pass/Fail Explicitly:**
   - Clear threshold values
   - Quantitative metrics
   - Boolean checks (yes/no)

3. **Include Evidence Collection:**
   - What artifacts prove gate passage
   - Where artifacts are stored
   - How to reproduce validation

4. **Specify Failure Handling:**
   - What happens if gate fails
   - Who decides on waivers
   - How to retry after fixes

5. **Provide Automation Hooks:**
   - Script command to run validation
   - CI/CD integration snippet
   - Manual fallback procedure

---

### **[STRICT]** EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS

Every protocol **MUST**:

1. **Capture Execution Evidence:**
   - All decisions made during execution
   - All user confirmations and approvals
   - All quality gate results
   - All errors and their resolutions

2. **Store Evidence Consistently:**
   - Use `.artifacts/protocol-[N]/` as primary storage
   - Use `.cursor/context-kit/` for context artifacts
   - Follow naming convention: `[protocol-N]-[artifact-type]-[timestamp].ext`

3. **Generate Evidence Manifest:**
   - Create `evidence-manifest.json` listing all artifacts
   - Include metadata: creation time, creator, purpose, consumer
   - Update manifest atomically with artifact creation

4. **Enable Evidence Traceability:**
   - Link artifacts to source protocol
   - Link artifacts to downstream consumers
   - Provide audit trail from start to finish

---

### **[STRICT]** AUTOMATION REQUIREMENTS

Every protocol **MUST**:

1. **Consolidate Automation Hooks:**
   - Create dedicated "AUTOMATION HOOKS" section
   - List all validation scripts with full paths
   - Provide CI/CD integration examples
   - Document manual fallback procedures

2. **Validate Automation References:**
   - Ensure referenced scripts exist in `/scripts/` directory
   - Provide script invocation examples with parameters
   - Document expected outputs and exit codes

3. **Support Tool-Agnostic Execution:**
   - Provide both automated and manual paths
   - Don't assume specific tools (GitHub Actions, etc.)
   - Allow execution in any environment
