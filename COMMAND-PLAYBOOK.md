## üéØ Success Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Follow Sequence**: Execute protocols in numerical order
2. **Collect Evidence**: Document all actions and decisions
3. **Validate Gates**: Ensure all quality gates pass
4. **Use Context**: Leverage `@codebase`, `@recent-changes`, `@filename`
5. **Check Prerequisites**: Verify all prerequisites before execution

### Common Patterns
- **Client Projects**: Use full lifecycle (01-22)
- **Technical Projects**: Use development cycle (05-12)
- **Emergency Response**: Use incident protocols (17-18)
- **Maintenance**: Use maintenance protocols (19-23)

### Troubleshooting
- **Missing Prerequisites**: Check required artifacts and approvals
- **Failed Gates**: Address issues and re-run validation
- **Integration Problems**: Verify protocol dependencies
- **Evidence Issues**: Ensure complete documentation
