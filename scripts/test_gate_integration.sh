# Greeting

Hello! Thank you for considering us for this project.

## Understanding Your Needs

I understand you need a mobile application with real-time capabilities.

### Proposed Approach

We will use React Native and Firebase to deliver a cross-platform solution.

## Deliverables and Timeline

Phase 1: Design (2 weeks)
Phase 2: Development (6 weeks)
Phase 3: Testing (2 weeks)

### Collaboration Model

Weekly video calls and daily Slack updates to keep you informed.

## Next Steps

Let's schedule a kickoff call to align on priorities and timelines.
