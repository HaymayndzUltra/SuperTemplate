# üìÅ Generators System ‚Äì Protocol & Evidence Automation

The `generators/` directory hosts the tooling, prompts, and forms that let AI assistants and operators derive new workflow assets directly from the 23-protocol lifecycle. Two primary outcomes drive this folder:

1. **Meta-analysis generation** ‚Äì Translate any protocol into a structured analysis artifact for audits or validator inputs.
2. **Protocol drafting** ‚Äì Produce brand-new protocols from standardized inputs while preserving the canonical format and governance requirements.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Need an Analysis?
1. Open `meta-analysis-generator-instructions.md`.
2. Provide the target protocol markdown.
3. Request an AI assistant to generate the analysis document.

### Need a New Protocol?
1. Fill out `protocol-input-form.yaml` (clone `sample-filled-form.yaml` for guidance).
2. Feed the populated form into `protocol-generator-instructions.md`.
3. Validate the draft against the canonical structure (purpose, prerequisites, steps, evidence, quality gates, script hooks).

### Cross-check Outcomes
- Use `analysis-*.md` files to confirm evidence layers (structural, process, decision, integration) are captured.
- Feed generated protocols back into the meta-analysis workflow to ensure consistency with validator expectations.

## üîÑ Feedback Loop with the 23-Protocol Lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Brief[Project Inputs] --> Form[Protocol Input Form]
    Form -->|AI Draft| Protocol
    Protocol -->|AI Analysis| Analysis
    Analysis -->|Validator Inputs| Validators
    Validators -->|Score & Gaps| Improvement
    Improvement -->|Revision| Protocol
```

This closed loop keeps new or revised protocols aligned with governance requirements and downstream validator criteria.

## ‚úÖ Usage Checklist

- [ ] Identify target protocol or desired workflow outcome.
- [ ] Prepare the latest context (brief, gates, evidence expectations).
- [ ] Use the matching generator prompt (analysis or protocol drafting).
- [ ] Validate outputs against `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/AGENTS.md` and integration maps.
- [ ] Archive generated artifacts in `.artifacts/` with evidence manifests if promoted to production.

## üß≠ Suggested Learning Path

1. Read `QUICK-START-GENERATORS.md` for orientation.
2. Review `GENERATOR-SYSTEM-SUMMARY.md` to understand architecture and safeguards.
3. Study the sample pair (`sample-filled-form.yaml`, `6-deployment-automation.md`, `analysis-6-deployment-automation.md`).
4. Run the loop end-to-end with a low-risk protocol before proposing changes to core protocols.

## ü§ù Support & Contributions

- Governance rules live in `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/AGENTS.md` and `COMMAND-PLAYBOOK.md`.
- When submitting new protocols, include the filled YAML form and matching analysis artifact.
- Flag improvements or gaps via `documentation/pr-reviews/` playbooks to route feedback through protocol governors.

Everything in this directory is built to keep protocol evolution consistent, auditable, and aligned with the AI-driven workflow lifecycle. Use it to extend the system responsibly! üöÄ
