# Generator: Protocol 6 – Technical Design & Architecture Specification

## 1. Purpose
Provide structured instructions for AI agents to transform the filled `protocol-input-form-6-technical-design.yaml` into the production-ready protocol file `6-technical-design-architecture.md` inside `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/`. The generated protocol must align with architecture governance, reference validated artifacts, and remain analyzable by the meta-analysis system.

## 2. Required Inputs
- `protocol-input-form-6-technical-design.yaml` (must be fully populated)
- `PROJECT-BRIEF.md`, `BRIEF-APPROVAL-RECORD.json`, discovery artifacts (for traceability examples)
- Existing protocols: `01-project-brief-creation.md`, `02-generate-tasks.md` (for integration references)
- Script registry: confirm availability of `validate_brief.py`, `plan_from_brief.py`, `validate_workflow_integration.py`

## 3. 4-Layer Architecture Mapping
### Layer 1 – System-Level Decisions
- Mission: Solutions Architect converting approved brief into technical design
- Guardrails: No invention beyond validated requirements; maintain evidence trail
- Prerequisites: Protocols 00B, 01; approvals required before design

### Layer 2 – Behavioral Control
- Quality gates: Source alignment, architecture integrity, design validation, stakeholder approval
- Halt conditions: Missing artifacts, failed validation, absent approvals
- Validation prompts: Stakeholder sign-off, handoff confirmation

### Layer 3 – Procedural Logic
- Phases: Source validation → Architecture decomposition → Specification packaging → Review & handoff
- Evidence artifacts: Source alignment report, ADR log, diagrams, validation report, approval record
- Automation hooks: `validate_brief.py`, `plan_from_brief.py`, `validate_workflow_integration.py`

### Layer 4 – Communication Grammar
- Status templates: `[PHASE {N} START]` / `[PHASE {N} COMPLETE]`
- Automation announcements: `[AUTOMATION] {script} executed: {status}`
- Validation prompts: `[VALIDATION REQUEST]`, `[APPROVAL CONFIRMATION]`
- Error messages: Missing artifacts, validation failure, approval pending

## 4. Protocol Template Structure
The generated markdown must contain:
1. H1 heading with protocol number, name, and compliance domain
2. Section **1. AI ROLE AND MISSION** with role, mission, critical guardrail
3. Section **2. TECHNICAL DESIGN WORKFLOW** with four numbered steps, each containing `[MUST]/[GUIDELINE]` actions, communications, evidence, automation
4. Section **3. INTEGRATION POINTS** (inputs/outputs)
5. Section **4. QUALITY GATES** (four gates with criteria/evidence/failure handling)
6. Section **5. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS** with announcements, prompts, error handling
7. Section **6. AUTOMATION HOOKS** mapping scripts to phases
8. Section **7. HANDOFF CHECKLIST** with completion checklist and closing command

## 5. Automation Hook Embedding Rules
- List script commands exactly as executed (with paths/flags)
- Provide context for each hook (phase, purpose, expected output)
- Ensure directories `.artifacts/design/` and filenames match evidence references

## 6. Quality Acceptance Criteria
- All required sections present with correct heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Every step contains explicit action, communication template, evidence location
- Quality gates align with input form data and include failure handling
- Integration points match upstream/downstream protocols
- Communication templates use uppercase bracket notation and consistent phrasing
- No TODOs or placeholder text; all filenames and directories valid

## 7. Generation Workflow for the AI
1. Validate form completeness and prerequisites
2. Map form data to four execution phases ensuring `[MUST]/[GUIDELINE]` markers match `action_type`
3. Populate integration, automation, and communication sections using template rules
4. Cross-check evidence artifacts for consistent naming (.artifacts/design/...)
5. Insert validation prompts and error handling from form
6. Perform self-check ensuring guardrail and mission statements align with inputs
7. Output markdown file at `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/6-technical-design-architecture.md`

## 8. Output & Post-Generation Actions
- Save final protocol to `.cursor/ai-driven-workflow/6-technical-design-architecture.md`
- Recommend running meta-analysis generator to validate 4-layer compliance
- If validation fails, revise sections based on feedback and regenerate
