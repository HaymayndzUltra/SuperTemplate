WORKFLOW\n<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-FORMATS - Mixed variants by step] -->\n\n### STEP 1: Context Alignment\n<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->\n<!-- Why: Simple workflow steps for feature intent and architectural mapping -->\n\n**Reasoning Pattern:** Align-before-elaborate heuristic \u2014 systematically validate feature intent and architectural placement before elaborating requirements. This prevents wasted effort on requirements that don't align with architectural constraints.\n\n**Pattern Improvement:** Track alignment failures to identify common gaps between feature intent and architectural constraints. Refine layer detection logic based on execution feedback. Iteratively improve architectural mapping templates.\n\n**Example Scenario:** When confirming feature intent, determine if effort is net-new feature or modification. If intent unclear, halt and request stakeholder clarification. Then map feature to architectural layer (frontend, backend, data pipeline) using discovery inputs and architecture principles. Therefore, requirements elaboration proceeds with validated architectural context, preventing downstream rework.\n\n**Strategy Rationale:** Because PRD serves as implementation contract between product and engineering, ensuring alignment with architectural constraints before requirements elaboration prevents engineering conflicts. This systematic alignment reduces PRD rework and accelerates implementation.\n\n**User Interaction**: \"Please confirm the feature intent and architectural placement. Does this align with your technical vision?\"\n\n**Meta-Cognitive Check:** Before confirming feature intent, assess your own limitations:\n- **Awareness:** Recognize that feature intent may be ambiguous or conflicting, requiring stakeholder clarification\n- **Limitations:** Understand that architectural layer detection may require technical lead validation if constraints are unclear\n- **Capacity:** Acknowledge that context alignment may require multiple stakeholder consultations, delaying requirements elaboration\n- **Correction:** Be prepared to escalate unclear intent to product owner or technical lead for resolution\n\n**Decision Tree:** When aligning context:\n- **IF** feature intent is clear (net-new or modification) \u2192 Proceed to architectural mapping\n- **ELSE IF** feature intent is ambiguous \u2192 Halt and request stakeholder clarification, document in `prd-context.json`\n- **IF** architectural layer detected and technical lead approved \u2192 Proceed to requirements elaboration\n- **IF** layer detection unclear \u2192 Document constraints and request technical lead validation\n- **THEN** Capture stakeholder goals aligned with project brief\n\n1. **`[MUST]` Confirm Feature Intent:**\n   * **Action:** Determine whether the effort is a net-new feature or modification; capture rationale in `prd-context.json`.\n   * **Reasoning:** Apply align-before-elaborate pattern \u2014 validate feature intent before proceeding to requirements elaboration. Use decision tree above to determine next steps based on intent clarity.\n   * **Problem-Solving:** If intent is unclear:\n  1. **Root Cause:** Identify why intent is ambiguous (stakeholder communication gap, incomplete discovery, or scope change)\n  2. **Solution:** Document ambiguity in `prd-context.json` and request clarification from product owner. If clarification delayed, mark as `REQUIRES_INPUT` and proceed with architecture mapping tentatively\n  3. **Validation:** Verify stakeholder confirmation recorded in JSON file before proceeding\n   * **Communication:** \n     > \"[MASTER RAY\u2122 | PHASE 1 START] - Validating feature intent and architectural placement.\"\n   * **Halt condition:** Await stakeholder clarification if intent unclear.\n   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/prd-context.json`\n   * **Validation:** Stakeholder confirmation recorded in JSON file\n\n2. **`[MUST]` Map to Architectural Layer:**\n   * **Action:** Use discovery inputs and architecture principles to identify primary implementation layer (e.g., frontend, backend, data pipeline) and announce detected layer.\n   * **Reasoning:** Use architectural layer detection pattern \u2014 systematically map feature to implementation layer using discovery inputs and architecture principles. This ensures requirements elaboration aligns with architectural constraints.\n   * **Decision Criteria:** When mapping to layer:\n  - **IF** feature primarily affects user interface \u2192 Map to frontend layer\n  - **ELSE IF** feature primarily affects business logic/APIs \u2192 Map to backend layer\n  - **IF** feature primarily affects data processing \u2192 Map to data pipeline layer\n  - **IF** feature spans multiple layers \u2192 Document primary layer and secondary dependencies\n   * **Communication:** \n     > \"Detected primary implementation layer: [layer]. Constraints: [communication, technology, governance].\"\n   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/layer-detection.md`\n   * **Validation:** Layer detection approved by technical lead\n\n3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Capture Stakeholder Goals:**\n   * **Action:** Summarize business goals, KPIs, and success metrics in `stakeholder-goals.md` for quick reference.\n   * **Reasoning:** Apply goals distillation pattern \u2014 extract key stakeholder goals from discovery inputs into concise reference document. This enables quick context retrieval during requirements elaboration.\n   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/stakeholder-goals.md`\n   * **Validation:** Goals aligned with project brief\n\n### STEP 2: Requirements Elaboration\n<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->\n<!-- Why: Straightforward requirements gathering and documentation -->\n\n**Reasoning Pattern:** Elaborate-with-validation strategy \u2014 systematically gather user narratives, functional requirements, and technical specs while validating completeness and alignment with architectural constraints. This ensures implementation-ready PRD that engineering can execute without ambiguity.\n\n**Example Scenario:** When gathering user narratives, elicit user stories aligned with detected architectural layer. If frontend layer detected, focus on UI/UX stories; if backend layer, focus on API and business logic stories. Then define functional requirements with acceptance criteria and specify technical requirements with API contracts. Therefore, PRD contains complete, actionable requirements aligned with architecture.\n\n**Strategy Rationale:** Because PRD serves as implementation contract, ensuring requirements are complete and aligned with architecture prevents engineering rework. This systematic elaboration ensures all requirements are actionable and traceable to user needs.\n\n**Decision Tree:** When elaborating requirements:\n- **IF** user stories gathered and personas covered \u2192 Proceed to functional requirements\n- **ELSE IF** user stories incomplete \u2192 Request additional user input or document assumptions\n- **IF** functional requirements defined with acceptance criteria \u2192 Proceed to technical requirements\n- **IF** technical requirements specified with API contracts \u2192 Proceed to risk planning\n- **THEN** Validate all requirements align with architectural layer and stakeholder goals\n\n1. **`[MUST]` Gather User Narratives:**\n   * **Action:** Elicit user stories and personas aligned with detected layer; store in `user-stories.md`.\n   * **Reasoning:** Apply user-centric elaboration pattern \u2014 gather user stories aligned with architectural layer. This ensures requirements reflect user needs while respecting architectural constraints.\n   * **Problem-Solving:** If user stories incomplete:\n  1. **Root Cause:** Identify why stories are incomplete (user unavailability, persona gaps, or layer misalignment)\n  2. **Solution:** Document incomplete stories with assumptions, request user interviews, or refine personas based on discovery inputs\n  3. **Validation:** Verify user stories cover all identified personas before proceeding\n   * **Communication:** \n     > \"[PHASE 2] - Capturing user stories and personas for PRD foundation.\"\n   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/user-stories.md`\n   * **Validation:** User stories cover all identified personas\n\n2. **`[MUST]` Define Functional Requirements:**\n   * **Action:** Detail feature behavior, workflows, acceptance criteria, and non-functional requirements in `functional-requirements.md`.\n   * **Reasoning:** Use systematic functional specification pattern \u2014 detail feature behavior with acceptance criteria to ensure requirements are testable and complete. This enables validation that implementation meets requirements.\n   * **Problem-Solving:** If functional requirements ambiguous:\n  1. **Root Cause:** Identify why requirements are ambiguous (behavior undefined, acceptance criteria missing, or workflow incomplete)\n  2. **Solution:** Elaborate ambiguous requirements with examples, refine acceptance criteria with measurable outcomes, or request stakeholder clarification\n  3. **Validation:** Verify all features have acceptance criteria defined before proceeding\n   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/functional-requirements.md`\n   * **Validation:** All features have acceptance criteria defined\n\n3. **`[MUST]` Specify Technical Requirements:**\n   * **Action:** Document API contracts, data models, integration points, security considerations, and system interactions in `technical-specs.md`.\n   * **Reasoning:** Apply technical specification pattern \u2014 document technical interfaces and constraints to guide engineering implementation. Use root cause analysis to ensure technical requirements address underlying architectural constraints.\n   * **Problem-Solving:** When specifying technical requirements:\n  1. **Root Cause:** Identify underlying technical constraints (API limitations, data model constraints, or integration dependencies)\n  2. **Solution:** Document technical requirements that address root constraints (e.g., \"API must support pagination due to high data volume\" addresses performance constraint)\n  3. **Validation:** Verify technical requirements reviewed by architecture team before proceeding\n   * **Communication:** \n     > \"Documenting technical interfaces and constraints to guide engineering.\"\n   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/technical-specs.md`\n   * **Validation:** Technical requirements reviewed by architecture team\n\n4. **`[GUIDELINE]` Populate Decision Matrix:**\n   * **Action:** Maintain architectural decision matrix linking need types to implementation targets.\n   * **Reasoning:** Use decision matrix pattern \u2014 systematically link user needs to implementation targets with constraints and notes. This enables traceability between requirements and implementation decisions.\n   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/decision-matrix.md`\n   \n   **Example (DO):**\n   ```markdown\n   | Need | Target | Constraints | Notes |\n   |------|--------|-------------|-------|\n   | Analytics KPI export | Backend service | Must align with GDPR retention | Use existing data warehouse pipeline |\n   ```\n\n### STEP 3: Risk, Dependency, and Validation Planning\n<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->\n<!-- Why: Simple risk assessment and validation planning steps -->\n\n**Reasoning Pattern:** Plan-before-assemble heuristic \u2014 systematically consolidate risks, define validation criteria, and align timeline before assembling PRD. This ensures PRD includes complete risk mitigation and validation planning.\n\n**Example Scenario:** When consolidating risks, aggregate risks from discovery into risk log and include new risks identified during requirements elaboration. Then define acceptance tests and validation criteria that are measurable and achievable. Finally, align timeline with business objectives. Therefore, PRD assembly includes complete risk and validation planning, enabling smooth implementation.\n\n**Strategy Rationale:** Because PRD serves as implementation contract, including risk mitigation and validation planning ensures implementation addresses risks and validates success. This systematic planning prevents implementation surprises and ensures validation success.\n\n**Decision Tree:** When planning risks and validation:\n- **IF** risks consolidated with mitigation plans \u2192 Proceed to validation criteria definition\n- **ELSE IF** high-severity risks lack mitigation \u2192 Document mitigation gaps and request stakeholder input\n- **IF** validation criteria defined and measurable \u2192 Proceed to timeline alignment\n- **IF** timeline aligns with business objectives \u2192 Proceed to PRD assembly\n- **THEN** Verify all high-severity risks have mitigation plans\n\n1. **`[MUST]` Consolidate Risks and Assumptions:**\n   * **Action:** Aggregate risks, assumptions, and mitigations from discovery into `risk-assumption-log.md`; include new items identified during elaboration.\n   * **Reasoning:** Apply risk consolidation pattern \u2014 systematically aggregate risks from discovery and requirements elaboration into unified risk log. Use root cause analysis to ensure mitigation strategies address underlying causes.\n   * **Problem-Solving:** When consolidating risks:\n  1. **Root Cause:** Identify underlying cause of each risk (e.g., \"API rate limiting risk\" \u2192 Root cause: \"Third-party API has strict rate limits\")\n  2. **Solution:** Develop mitigation that addresses root cause (e.g., \"Implement caching layer to reduce API calls\")\n  3. **Validation:** Verify all high-severity risks have mitigation plans before proceeding\n   * **Communication:** \n     > \"[PHASE 3] - Updating risk and assumption log for PRD readiness.\"\n   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/risk-assumption-log.md`\n   * **Validation:** All high-severity risks have mitigation plans\n\n2. **`[MUST]` Define Acceptance & Validation Criteria:**\n   * **Action:** Establish measurable acceptance tests, KPIs, and validation steps in `validation-plan.md`.\n   * **Reasoning:** Use measurable validation pattern \u2014 establish acceptance tests and KPIs that are measurable and achievable. This enables validation that implementation meets requirements.\n   * **Problem-Solving:** If validation criteria ambiguous:\n  1. **Root Cause:** Identify why criteria are ambiguous (KPIs undefined, acceptance tests not measurable, or validation steps unclear)\n  2. **Solution:** Define measurable KPIs (e.g., \"API response time < 200ms\"), create testable acceptance criteria (e.g., \"User can complete checkout in < 2 minutes\"), and specify validation steps\n  3. **Validation:** Verify validation criteria are measurable and achievable before proceeding\n   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/validation-plan.md`\n   * **Validation:** Validation criteria are measurable and achievable\n\n3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Align Timeline & Release Strategy:**\n   * **Action:** Outline milestones, release phases, and rollout strategy referencing `timeline-discussion.md`.\n   * **Reasoning:** Apply timeline alignment pattern \u2014 align PRD timeline with business objectives and release strategy. This ensures PRD supports business goals and enables smooth rollout.\n   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/timeline-discussion.md`\n   * **Validation:** Timeline aligns with business objectives\n\n### STEP 4: PRD Assembly and Automation\n<!-- [Category: EXECUTION-BASIC] -->\n<!-- Why: Straightforward document assembly and automation execution -->\n\n**Reasoning Pattern:** Assemble-with-validation strategy \u2014 systematically compile PRD sections, generate assets, and validate quality before finalization. This ensures PRD is complete, traceable, and implementation-ready.\n\n**Example Scenario:** When assembling PRD, compile context, requirements, risks, and validation sections into PRD document. Then run automation scripts to generate supporting artifacts (user stories, schemas, APIs). Finally, validate PRD quality with automation script. If validation fails, remediate and rerun. Therefore, PRD is complete, validated, and ready for engineering execution.\n\n**Strategy Rationale:** Because PRD serves as implementation contract, ensuring PRD is complete and validated before handoff prevents engineering rework. This systematic assembly and validation ensures PRD quality and implementation readiness.\n\n**Decision Tree:** When assembling PRD:\n- **IF** all mandatory sections populated \u2192 Proceed to asset generation\n- **ELSE IF** mandatory sections incomplete \u2192 Halt and request completion or document gaps\n- **IF** assets generated successfully \u2192 Proceed to PRD validation\n- **IF** PRD validation passes (score \u2265 85/100) \u2192 Proceed to traceability mapping\n- **ELSE IF** validation fails \u2192 Remediate issues and rerun validation\n- **THEN** Verify PRD contains all required sections and passes validation\n\n1. **`[MUST]` Assemble PRD Document:**\n   * **Action:** Compile context, requirements, risks, and validation sections into `prd-{feature}.md` following standard template.\n   * **Reasoning:** Apply systematic assembly pattern \u2014 compile all PRD sections from validated inputs into unified document. Use decision tree above to determine when to proceed based on section completeness.\n   * **Problem-Solving:** If mandatory sections incomplete:\n  1. **Root Cause:** Identify why sections are incomplete (content missing, stakeholder input delayed, or template gaps)\n  2. **Solution:** Document incomplete sections with placeholder text and follow-up plan, or request stakeholder completion before proceeding\n  3. **Validation:** Verify PRD contains all required sections before proceeding\n   * **Communication:** \n     > \"[PHASE 4] - Assembling implementation-ready PRD.\"\n   * **Halt condition:** Pause if any mandatory section lacks confirmed content.\n   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/prd-{feature}.md`\n   * **Validation:** PRD contains all required sections\n\n2. **`[MUST]` Generate PRD Assets:**\n   * **Action:** Run `python scripts/generate_prd_assets.py --prd .artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/prd-{feature}.md --output .artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/prd-assets/` to create supporting artifacts (user stories, schemas, APIs).\n   * **Reasoning:** Use automation pattern \u2014 generate supporting artifacts from PRD to enable engineering implementation. This automation reduces manual effort and ensures consistency.\n   * **Problem-Solving:** If asset generation fails:\n  1. **Root Cause:** Identify why generation failed (script error, PRD format issue, or missing dependencies)\n  2. **Solution:** Fix script errors, correct PRD format, or install missing dependencies, then rerun generation\n  3. **Validation:** Verify all asset files generated successfully before proceeding\n   * **Communication:** \n     > \"[RAY AUTOMATION] PRD assets generated and archived.\"\n   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/prd-assets/`\n   * **Validation:** All asset files generated successfully\n\n3. **`[MUST]` Validate PRD Quality:**\n   * **Action:** Execute `python scripts/validate_prd_gate.py --prd .artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/prd-{feature}.md --output .artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/prd-validation.json` ensuring completeness and alignment.\n   * **Reasoning:** Apply validation-before-handoff pattern \u2014 validate PRD quality before proceeding to handoff. Use decision tree above to determine when to proceed based on validation results.\n   * **Problem-Solving:** If validation fails:\n  1. **Root Cause:** Identify why validation failed (completeness gaps, alignment issues, or quality threshold not met)\n  2. **Solution:** Remediate validation failures (complete missing sections, fix alignment issues, or improve quality), then rerun validation\n  3. **Validation:** Verify PRD validation score \u2265 85/100 before proceeding\n   * **Communication:** \n     > \"PRD validation status: {status} - Score: {score}/100.\"\n   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/prd-validation.json`\n   * **Validation:** PRD validation score \u2265 85/100\n\n4. **`[GUIDELINE]` Record Traceability:**\n   * **Action:** Map PRD sections to source discovery artifacts in `prd-traceability.json`.\n   * **Reasoning:** Use traceability pattern \u2014 document source references for all PRD content to enable auditability and future updates. This ensures PRD remains synchronized with discovery evidence.\n   * **Evidence:** `.artifacts/artisans-corner-dashboard/protocol-06/prd-traceability.json`\n   * **Validation:** All PRD content traceable to source artifacts\n\n---\n\n## 4.

resources\n\n### 11.5 Meta-Cognition\n\n#### Self-Awareness and Process Awareness\n**Purpose:** Enable AI to maintain explicit awareness of execution state and limitations.\n\n**Awareness Statement Protocol:**\nAt each major execution checkpoint, generate awareness statement:\n- Current phase and step status\n- Artifacts completed vs. pending\n- Identified blockers and their severity\n- Confidence level in current outputs\n- Known limitations and assumptions\n- Required inputs for next steps\n\n#### Process Monitoring and Progress Tracking\n**Purpose:** Continuously track execution status and detect anomalies.\n\n- **Progress tracking:** Update execution status after each step\n- **Velocity monitoring:** Flag execution delays beyond expected duration\n- **Quality monitoring:**

REASONING & COGNITIVE PROCESS\n<!-- [Category: META-FORMATS] -->\n<!-- Why: Meta-level protocol analysis and reasoning patterns documentation -->\n\n### 11.1 Reasoning Patterns\n\n**Primary Reasoning Pattern: Systematic Execution**\n- Execute protocol steps sequentially with validation at each checkpoint\n\n**Secondary Reasoning Pattern: Quality-Driven Validation**\n- Apply quality gates to ensure artifact completeness before downstream handoff\n\n**Pattern Improvement Strategy:**\n- Track pattern effectiveness via quality gate pass rates and downstream protocol feedback\n- Quarterly review identifies pattern weaknesses and optimization opportunities\n- Iterate patterns based on empirical evidence from completed executions\n\n### 11.2 Decision Logic\n\n#### Decision Point 1: Execution Readiness\n**Context:** Determining if prerequisites are met to begin protocol execution\n\n**Decision Criteria:**\n- All prerequisite artifacts present\n- Required approvals obtained\n- System state validated\n\n**Outcomes:**\n- Proceed: Execute protocol workflow\n- Halt: Document missing prerequisites, notify stakeholders\n\n**Logging:** Record decision and prerequisites status in execution log\n\n### 11.3 Root Cause Analysis Framework\n\nWhen protocol execution encounters blockers or quality gate failures:\n\n1. **Identify Symptom:** What immediate issue prevented progress?\n2. **Trace to Root Cause:**\n   - Was prerequisite artifact missing or incomplete?\n   - Did upstream protocol deliver inadequate inputs?\n   - Were instructions ambiguous or insufficient?\n   - Did environmental conditions fail?\n3. **Document in Protocol Execution Log:**\n   ```markdown\n   **Blocker:** [Description]\n   **Root Cause:** [Analysis]\n   **Resolution:** [Action taken]\n   **Prevention:** [Process/template update to prevent recurrence]\n   ```\n4. **Implement Fix:** Update protocol, re-engage stakeholders, adjust execution\n5. **Validate Fix:** Re-run quality gates, confirm resolution\n\n### 11.4 Learning Mechanisms\n\n#### Feedback Loops\n**Purpose:** Establish continuous feedback collection to inform protocol improvements.\n\n- **Execution feedback:** Collect outcome data after each protocol execution\n- **Quality gate outcomes:** Track gate pass/fail patterns in historical logs\n- **Downstream protocol feedback:** Capture issues reported by dependent protocols\n- **Continuous monitoring:** Automated alerts for anomalies and degradation\n\n#### Improvement Tracking\n**Purpose:** Systematically track protocol effectiveness improvements over time.\n\n- **Metrics tracking:** Monitor key performance indicators in quarterly dashboards\n- **Template evolution:** Log all protocol template changes with rationale and impact\n- **Effectiveness

quality gate thresholds based on risk tolerance\n- **Workflow optimization:** Streamline steps based on historical efficiency data\n- **Tool selection:** Choose optimal automation based on available resources\n\n### 11.5 Meta-Cognition\n\n#### Self-Awareness and Process Awareness\n**Purpose:** Enable AI to maintain explicit awareness of execution state and limitations.\n\n**Awareness Statement Protocol:**\nAt each major execution checkpoint, generate awareness statement:\n- Current phase and step status\n- Artifacts completed vs. pending\n- Identified blockers and their severity\n- Confidence level in current outputs\n- Known limitations and assumptions\n- Required inputs for next steps\n\n#### Process Monitoring and Progress Tracking\n**Purpose:** Continuously track execution status and detect anomalies.\n\n- **Progress tracking:** Update execution status after each step\n- **Velocity monitoring:** Flag execution delays beyond expected duration\n- **Quality monitoring:** Track gate pass rates and artifact completeness\n- **Anomaly detection:** Alert on unexpected patterns or deviations\n\n#### Self-Correction Protocols\n**Purpose:** Enable autonomous detection and correction of execution issues.\n\n- **Halt condition detection:** Recognize blockers and escalate appropriately\n- **Quality gate failure handling:** Generate corrective action plans\n- **Anomaly response:** Diagnose and propose fixes for unexpected conditions\n- **Recovery procedures:** Maintain execution state for graceful resume\n\n#### Continuous Improvement Integration\n**Purpose:**

REASONING & COGNITIVE PROCESS\n<!-- [Category: META-FORMATS] -->\n<!-- Why: Meta-level protocol analysis and reasoning patterns documentation -->\n\n### 11.1 Reasoning Patterns\n\n**Primary Reasoning Pattern: Systematic Execution**\n- Execute protocol steps sequentially with validation at each checkpoint\n\n**Secondary Reasoning Pattern: Quality-Driven Validation**\n- Apply quality gates to ensure artifact completeness before downstream handoff\n\n**Pattern Improvement Strategy:**\n- Track pattern effectiveness via quality gate pass rates and downstream protocol feedback\n- Quarterly review identifies pattern weaknesses and optimization opportunities\n- Iterate patterns based on empirical evidence from completed executions\n\n### 11.2 Decision Logic\n\n#### Decision Point 1: Execution Readiness\n**Context:** Determining if prerequisites are met to begin protocol execution\n\n**Decision Criteria:**\n- All prerequisite artifacts present\n- Required approvals obtained\n- System state validated\n\n**Outcomes:**\n- Proceed: Execute protocol workflow\n- Halt: Document missing prerequisites, notify stakeholders\n\n**Logging:** Record decision and prerequisites status in execution log\n\n### 11.3 Root Cause Analysis Framework\n\nWhen protocol execution encounters blockers or quality gate failures:\n\n1. **Identify Symptom:** What immediate issue prevented progress?\n2. **Trace to Root Cause:**\n   - Was prerequisite artifact missing or incomplete?\n   - Did upstream protocol deliver inadequate inputs?\n   - Were instructions ambiguous or insufficient?\n   - Did environmental conditions fail?\n3. **Document in Protocol Execution Log:**\n   ```markdown\n   **Blocker:** [Description]\n   **Root Cause:** [Analysis]\n   **Resolution:** [Action taken]\n   **Prevention:** [Process/template update to prevent recurrence]\n   ```\n4. **Implement Fix:** Update protocol, re-engage stakeholders, adjust execution\n5. **Validate Fix:** Re-run quality gates, confirm resolution\n\n### 11.4 Learning Mechanisms\n\n#### Feedback Loops\n**Purpose:** Establish continuous feedback collection to inform protocol improvements.\n\n- **Execution feedback:** Collect outcome data after each protocol execution\n- **Quality gate outcomes:** Track gate pass/fail patterns in historical logs\n- **Downstream protocol feedback:** Capture issues reported by dependent protocols\n- **Continuous monitoring:** Automated alerts for anomalies and degradation\n\n#### Improvement Tracking\n**Purpose:** Systematically track protocol effectiveness improvements over time.\n\n- **Metrics tracking:** Monitor key performance indicators in quarterly dashboards\n- **Template evolution:** Log all protocol template changes with rationale and impact\n- **Effectiveness

quality gate thresholds based on risk tolerance\n- **Workflow optimization:** Streamline steps based on historical efficiency data\n- **Tool selection:** Choose optimal automation based on available resources\n\n### 11.5 Meta-Cognition\n\n#### Self-Awareness and Process Awareness\n**Purpose:** Enable AI to maintain explicit awareness of execution state and limitations.\n\n**Awareness Statement Protocol:**\nAt each major execution checkpoint, generate awareness statement:\n- Current phase and step status\n- Artifacts completed vs. pending\n- Identified blockers and their severity\n- Confidence level in current outputs\n- Known limitations and assumptions\n- Required inputs for next steps\n\n#### Process Monitoring and Progress Tracking\n**Purpose:** Continuously track execution status and detect anomalies.\n\n- **Progress tracking:** Update execution status after each step\n- **Velocity monitoring:** Flag execution delays beyond expected duration\n- **Quality monitoring:** Track gate pass rates and artifact completeness\n- **Anomaly detection:** Alert on unexpected patterns or deviations\n\n#### Self-Correction Protocols\n**Purpose:** Enable autonomous detection and correction of execution issues.\n\n- **Halt condition detection:** Recognize blockers and escalate appropriately\n- **Quality gate failure handling:** Generate corrective action plans\n- **Anomaly response:** Diagnose and propose fixes for unexpected conditions\n- **Recovery procedures:** Maintain execution state for graceful resume\n\n#### Continuous Improvement Integration\n**Purpose:** Systematically capture lessons and evolve protocol effectiveness.\n\n- **Retrospective execution:** Conduct after-action reviews post-completion\n- **Template review cadence:** Scheduled protocol enhancement cycles\n- **Gate calibration:** Periodic adjustment of pass criteria\n- **Tool evaluation:** Assessment of automation effectiveness\n\n---\n\n## SCRIPTS & AUTOMATION\n\n### Automation
