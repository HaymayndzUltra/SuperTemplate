# AI-Driven Workflow System Documentation Update Prompt

## Mission
Update the root README.md to comprehensively document the complete AI-driven workflow system with all 28 protocols and create a user command playbook for the entire lifecycle.

## Context
You have a sophisticated AI-driven workflow system with:
- **28 protocols** covering complete SDLC (01-27)
- **8 master rules** for AI behavior
- **Complete client lifecycle** from proposal to closure
- **Quality audit system** with multiple review modes
- **Evidence-based delivery** with validation gates
- **Automation integration** with scripts and CI/CD

## Requirements

### 1. Update Root README.md
Create a comprehensive README.md that includes:

#### A. System Overview
- What is the AI-driven workflow system
- Core philosophy and principles
- Target users and use cases
- Key benefits and capabilities

#### B. Complete Protocol Inventory (28 protocols)
Organize by phases with clear descriptions:

**Phase 0: Foundation & Discovery (01-05)**
- 01-client-proposal-generation.md
- 02-client-discovery-initiation.md  
- 03-project-brief-creation.md
- 04-project-bootstrap-and-context-engineering.md
- 05-bootstrap-your-project.md

**Phase 1-2: Planning & Design (06-09)**
- 06-create-prd.md
- 07-technical-design-architecture.md
- 08-generate-tasks.md
- 09-environment-setup-validation.md

**Phase 3: Development (10-11)**
- 10-process-tasks.md
- 11-integration-testing.md

**Phase 4: Quality & Testing (12-14)**
- 12-quality-audit.md
- 13-uat-coordination.md
- 14-pre-deployment-staging.md

**Phase 5: Deployment & Operations (15-18)**
- 15-production-deployment.md
- 16-monitoring-observability.md
- 17-incident-response-rollback.md
- 18-performance-optimization.md

**Phase 6: Closure & Maintenance (19-23)**
- 19-documentation-knowledge-transfer.md
- 20-project-closure.md
- 21-maintenance-support.md
- 22-implementation-retrospective.md
- 23-script-governance-protocol.md

**Supporting Protocols (24-27)**
- 24-client-discovery.md
- 25-protocol-integration-map.md
- 26-integration-guide.md
- 27-validation-guide.md

#### C. Master Rules System
Document the 8 master rules and their purposes

#### D. Quality Audit System
Explain the review protocols and quality gates

#### E. Automation Integration
Document scripts, CI/CD integration, and automation hooks

### 2. Create Complete Lifecycle Command Playbook
Create a comprehensive command playbook that users can copy-paste to execute the entire workflow:

#### A. Client Project Lifecycle Commands
Complete sequence from client discovery to project closure

#### B. Technical Development Commands
Development-focused workflow for technical projects

#### C. Quality Assurance Commands
Quality audit and validation sequences

#### D. Emergency Response Commands
Incident response and rollback procedures

#### E. Maintenance Commands
Ongoing maintenance and support procedures
